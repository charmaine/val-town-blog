Val Town is growing up! We're working on features and infra that will fundamentally unlock the scope and scale of what you can build in Val Town. We have two major efforts running in parallel: projects and scalability.

_Projects_ are containers for multiple vals, folders, and files. The enable you to create infinitely complex real-world apps, instead of being limited to a single long val. Internal to a project, vals will use relative imports (ie `./foo/bar`), so they can be forked as a unit, and merged back in as a unit. Projects will also improve Townie's ability to help write your vals in more modular files, so that it doesn't have to regenerate all the code on every change.

_Scalability_ will enable you to run production workloads in Val Town, with usage-based pricing, custom alerts, and caps.

We hope to have both of these efforts live in the coming months. In the meantime, we've shipped many other features and improvements, including a dozen Townie upgrades, scoped API permissions, a partnership with Fal, and more.

[Justin Bennett](https://just-be.dev) has joined our team! He is well-known for the [DevtoolsFM podcast](https://www.devtools.fm/), and was most recently at [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), [Membrane](https://www.membrane.io/), and [Oxide](https://oxide.computer/). We've known Justin for years, and are thrilled he's on the team.

As per usual, the [highlight of our newsletter is at the bottom: a list of the most interesting community vals we've seen this month](), including a bunch working with the Bluesky API, a Val Town clone built on Val Town, Stripe examples, virtual money, data journalism, lightning-fast Cerebras 2k-tokens-per-second demos, and dozens more!

## ü§ñ Townie upgrades

Townie has been massively upgraded this month. We shipped some of the most common feature request and fixed the worst bugs.

<video controls loop class="image-rounded">
  <source src="/video/CerebrasCoderAnalyticsTownie.mp4" />
</video>

_This video shows me adding analytics to [Cerebras Coder](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/cerebras_coder), a minimal Townie clone, powered by [Cerebras](https://cerebras.ai/)'s lightning-fast inference. The video shows switching from Haiku to Sonnet; Townie detecting a server-side error; fixing it upon request; fixing another bug; viewing older versions of the val; and a notice to start a new chat because longer chats make Townie dumber._

- By far the most common feature request for Townie has been the ability to preview the older versions of HTTP vals. This is now live! There's a dropdown in the bottom of the Preview tab in Townie to select an older version to preview, with the ability to restore that version. Thanks [Charlie](https://www.val.town/u/dcm31) for the tip to add the Restore button, and [Matt](https://www.val.town/u/neverstew) for the feedback on the wording of the button üôè
- In order to make Townie sustainable, we rolled out usage limits. Now free-tier users can try out Townie for about a dozen messages on a Haiku, a cheaper (albeit still fantastic) model. We hope this will help you get a sense of what Townie can do, and encourage you to upgrade to Pro if you want to use it regularly. If you find that you're hitting your limits as a Pro user, please reach out to me at steve@val.town with more context on your use case. We're eagerly looking for feedback on a higher-level Pro tier or usage-based pricing.
- We deployed Anthropic prompt caching ([try it on Val Town](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/anthropicCaching)), which saves 40% on cost, and improves latency by up to 85% for long prompts.
- We rolled out Sonnet 3.5 New, which is supposed to be even better at coding, but unfortunately had to rollback to Sonnet 3.5 Old, because the New version was resistant to writing very large blocks of code in their entirety. It added a lot of `// code remains unchanged here`. We fixed that issue with Anthropic's help, and are working through a couple other system prompt issues with Sonnet 3.5 New, and hope to get it rolled out in the coming weeks.
- Townie now detects many client-side and server-side errors automatically, and has a clean UI to view the errors to help you decide if you want to debug them manually, dismiss them, or ask Townie to solve them for you.
- At long-last we fixed bugs with the Townie code editor getting out of sync or showing "unsaved changes" when there weren't any.

If you'd like to read more about behind-the-scenes of Townie, Tom gave a talk, which he turned into a blog post: [Building a Code Writing Robot](https://blog.val.town/blog/building-a-code-writing-robot/).

## üîê Scoped Permissions

We added API scopes to Val Town API tokens to give you more granular control over our REST API.

We have read/write scopes for:

- `val` ‚Äì [vals](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/vals)
- `user` ‚Äì [user account details](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/me)
- `blob` ‚Äì [blob storage](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/blobs)
- `sqlite` ‚Äì [sqlite database](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/sqlite)
- `email` ‚Äì [ability to send emails](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/emails)

The [API tokens page](https://www.val.town/settings/api)
now lets you view and configure the scope of each token.
You can also configure the scope of for each individual val on its settings page.

## üåÑ Fal Partnership

We announced a partnership with [Fal](https://fal.ai/), to bring their
lightning-fast image generation API to Val Town users.

## Updated Pricing Page

We've made some long-overdue updates to our [pricing page](https://www.val.town/pricing).

<Image src={Pricing} alt="Val Town Pricing Page at val.town/pricing" />

Here's what changed:

- Expanded the Pro tier from 100 to 500 HTTP val req/min ‚Äì thanks [Izu](https://www.val.town/u/izuchukwu) for the request üôè
- Listed custom domains on the Pro tier
- Lowered the number of private or unlisted vals on the Free tier from 100 to 10. (We have yet to enforce this. When we enforce it, we will grandfather in any vals created before.)
- Removed some stale limitations we never enforced

We don't enforce all of these limits today. For example, Free tier users can make over 10 runs per minute. We're figuring out the right balance between signalling what we can support at scale, without adding unnecessary friction for users.

## Blob Storage admin

Want to view and edit the blobs stored in your [Val Town Blob Storage](https://docs.val.town/std/blob/)? Now you have two great options.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### Projects

Our biggest effort coming up is _Projects_ - groups of vals, files, folders that will be forkable as a unit and mergeable as a unit, supporting relative imports, and more. Where a val is like a Github gist, a Project is like a Github repo. Projects will enable you to build infinitely complex real-world apps in Val Town. We're excited to share something hopefully in Dec 2024, and if not in Jan 2025.

<Image src={Projects} alt="Screenshot of an example Val Town Project" />

We shared the above screenshot of an example Projects a couple weeks back in our Discord. One of our users, [Victor], was so inspired that he's started building larger projects in Val Town already in advance of Projects, living in the future by pretending that they already exist. His most recent large val project was [NotUber](https://vawogbemi-notuber.web.val.run/), a surprisingly full-featured Uber/Lyft clone. The best part is that he built [another val that acts as the 'project view' for the 8 vals that NotUber depends on](https://vawogbemi-notuberfolder.web.val.run/). We love Victor's vision, and we can't wait to see what everyone else builds once Projects ship for real!

### Scale

We're also working on _Scale_ ‚Äì a new infra architecture that will enable you to run production workloads in Val Town, with scale to infinity, usage-based pricing, with usage alerts, and caps. Websocket-type vals will also launch with this effort.

### Other features coming soon

- Val- & Project- scoped environment variables
- Searchable & filterable logs and traces
- /explore - a new page to find interesting vals
- Allow hyphens in val names
- Improved code search
- Comments on pull requests
- Ability to follow a user on Val Town
- Team accounts
- SOC2 compliance (I told you we're growing up!)
- ...and much more!

Please [make feature requests and vote](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions?discussions) on what you'd like to see next.
