## ü§ñ Townie upgrades

- Restore past versions - probably a video for this one! (like the one on twitter and discord)
- Anthropic Prompt Caching, saving 40% and perf improvement
- Upgraded to Sonnet 3.5 New (maybe worse?)
- Haiku - need to figure out what we're doing here
  - if we add it, track the model in the db
- Detects more server-side errors automatically
- Lets you view errors before sending them back to Townie
- Have it include the deployed URL in its response
- Get it to not reply with "// code remains unchanged"
- https://blog.val.town/blog/building-a-code-writing-robot/
- Limits & credits are coming as fast as we can
  - Free users will get to try Townie, using Haiku, but not very much
  - Pro users will get higher limits
  - If you hit the daily limits, please email steve@val.town if you'd like to inquire about purchasing a higher plan. We'd love your input on how much you'd like to pay to use Townie more!
