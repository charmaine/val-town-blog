description: Moving off of Supabase and enhancing our security with restricted library mode

The last month saw us do two huge infrastructure projects: moving off of
Supabase and moving to Restricted Library Mode semantics. We also shipped dozens
of smaller improvements, including the ability to ❤️ a val, inline npm search, an
onboarding tutorial, val references, redesigned tracing, API tokens, and more!

The roadmap over the coming months is incredibly exciting! I don’t know exactly
in what order we’ll get to everything, but we’re planning simpler privacy
controls, oauth helpers, error reporting, pricing, subdomains, typescript
imports, comments, readmes, a vscode plugin, GPT somewhere, a legit logo, swag,
and much more!

I didn’t have time to compile a “cool vals” section for this newsletter, but you
can help me do it for next time by liking vals that you find interesting or
useful. The explore page does rank vals with more likes higher, and we’ll
continue to iterate on its formula over the coming weeks.

### Changelog

### Migrated off Supabase

We found ourselves being slowed down by Supabase, so we took a couple weeks to
move off it, with zero downtime! We’re now on trpc, zod, drizzle, and can run
test and local copy of our database, including in preview branches and github
actions tests. We’ve gotten a lot of questions about this, so you can expect a
blog post about it this week.

### Restricted Library Mode & v1 API

We shifted our semantics to be safer and more explicit, and launched our API v1
around the new semantics. This was a big effort and a breaking change, so we
really appreciate how everyone stepped up to make this as seamless as possible.
If you’ve been using Val Town for a while, you should probably read about the
change:
[Restricted Library Mode](https://blog.val.town/blog/restricted-library-mode).

### Val references (backlinks)

You can now click on the references for each val. You can see that
`@stevekrouse.fetchJSON` was referenced 619 times, and when you click on it you
can see the 208 vals that use it that are public.

### Tracing (evaluations) redesign

Tom redesigned our tracing view. If you are logged in, you will be able to click
the number of times a val has been run, and then view all runs of that val that
happened in your Val Town account. (You won’t be able to see when other people
ran that val on their account. You _will_ be able to see it if they ran it via
your API. These semantics are discussed in the
[Restricted Library Mode](https://blog.val.town/blog/restricted-library-mode)
blog post.)

### Val Town API Tokens

We made a proper page to get your Val Town API tokens. We now also support
multiple tokens, and the ability to delete tokens:
[/settings/api](https://www.val.town/settings/api).

### All Val Versions

Sometimes it’s useful to see every version of every val you’ve ever created,
including deleted vals, so you can restore them.

### First YouTube / TikTok / podcast / livestream

I made a YouTube video and TikToks about how to send form data to Val Town. I
was also on the devtools FM podcast and endingwithali’s livestream. Please reach
out if you have a podcast or livestream and you’d like to chat about Val Town,
devtools, the future of coding, etc ❤️

### Gallery

[We threw together a little gallery](https://gallery.val.town/), so you could
see how folks connect Val Town to their favorite apps, like OpenAI GPT, Discord,
Slack, Google Sheets, Github, Telegram, Mastodon, Resy, Twitter, etc.

### Page navigation loading progress bar

When you click on a link that takes a couple seconds to load, you’ll see the
classic progress bar loader at the top of the screen.

### Userspace Cron

While it may take us another couple of weeks to build cron into the product, I
did throw together a version that works in userspace!

<div class="not-content">
  <iframe src="https://www.val.town/embed/@stevekrouse.cron" width="100%" frameborder="no" style="height: 400px;">

### Where did you hear about us?

I know it’s annoying but we need to know where folks are hearing about us.

### Clickable URLs in the val editor

Press cmd, then click.

### Misc

- the empty new val editor component is on almost every page (the homepage,
  user’s profiles, viewing a single val) even when logged out
- much fewer auth bugs
- userspace [cron](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse.cron) (proper cron in the
  product should be coming soon)
- swr → react-query
- stop crashing on Safari 15
- Upgrade to deno 1.33.0

all will happen in, so reach out if you have strong preferences on what happens
sooner rather than later.
