It's been over two months since our last update and boy have things changed since then! In this newsletter we'll be talking about Val Town's recent funding round, how that's changed the team and our priorities and, of course, the amazing work that our community has been building on Val Town.

Prefer video? This newsletter has a video talkthrough as well.

## Val Town's Seed Round

You might have seen it already on this blog, but this month [Val Town raised $5.5m](https://blog.val.town/blog/seed/) in a round led by Accel. We've also gained Dan Levine on our board, someone we couldn't have built Val Town without.
TODO: write a better line above

We want Val Town to be a place where your ideas are so fast and easy to turn into reality that you can whip them up in minutes without worrying about any future concerns. Your ideas are already productionised from the second you write your first line of code.
Doing that with the quality that we're happy with is no mean feat (Val Town is running (10x more vals)[https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1775901639234187402] than this time last year!) and it's going to take us some time. This round of funding means that we can focus on Val Town being around long-term and make sustainable, revenue-backed choices in [close collaboration with you, our community](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions).

To get a better idea of how that's already happening, there's much more below.

### Hiring

First things first, we'd like to give a big welcome to Max, the newest member of the Val Town team.
TODO: write something about Max.

</div>

You might have seen him on the Discord as @maxmcd already, fixing bugs and working on some of our most requested features.

If you'd like to be part of our growing team, we're hiring a design engineer and generalist engineer in Brooklyn. [Join us!](https://www.val.town/careers)

### Code Search and Performance Improvements

Two of our most wanted features, both by the team and the community, are [Better Search](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/69) and [Better Performance](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113).
Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes here. Fortunately, we have two fantastic people working on them and they're making some great progress that we wanted to update everyone on.

You might have seen the fruits of Tom's labour already; he published [Code Search is Hard](https://blog.val.town/blog/search-notes/) and it went straight to the front page of Hacker News!
We want to get Code Search right. It's an integral part of making vals easier to find, share and re-use, so we're investing a lot of time into finding the right solution.
We've experimented with a number of options already but finding that sweet spot isn't easy. For more details, check out [Tom's original post](https://blog.val.town/blog/search-notes/).

_(An aside here for a community shoutout to [@pomdtr](https://www.val.town/u/pomdtr), who very quickly showed us [an unexpected way](https://pomdtr-code_search_is_easy.web.val.run/) to search through public vals... by uploading them all the GitHub!)_

For all things performance, we head to our newest member of the team, Max. He wrote [a detailed update](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113#discussioncomment-9097473) on where his investigations have led so far.
In summary, he's found a few immediate targets for improving performance:
- eliminating unexplained network overhead should reduce the latency by just over 40%
- similarly, we incur a similar overhead when loading module code, which should be mostly eliminated
- optimising database queries that run ahead of val execution should shave of a few more percent

With these main targets identified, we think we can get vals from 300ms to under 100ms in the next couple of months, maybe sooner. Keep your fingers crossed and your eyes on that discussion!

TODO decide on this section - might be worth talking about?

## Town Updates

In Val Town, a lot can happen in two months. Here's a really quick summary of some of the changes that have been happening.

- Val Town has a new integration with OpenAI. Accessing the power of AI is now only a std lib call away, using [@std/openai](https://www.val.town/v/std/openai). Every user can use this, for free, with a rate limit of ten calls per minute.
- Vals can now be re-triggered by replaying previous inputs. This is a great [community feature request](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/73) that makes testing your vals, especially ones generated by external services, much easier. You'll find a refresh button next to each line of your vals logs to activate this.
- Val Town has a new quick menu, where you can take common actions like creating a new val, navigate straight to specific pages or search for vals. Access it by using âŒ˜-K or CTRL-K.
- We've been updating the onboarding flow for new users to make it easier to get started with Val Town. If you're a new user and you have any feedback, please send it to <a href="mailto:feedback@val.town">feedback@val.town</a>!
- You can now link to line ranges in vals using familiar, GitHub-like syntax: https://www.val.town/v/nbbaier/readmeGPT#L20-29
- HTTP vals have a preview with an editable URL, to make previewing your web pages much easier
- New keybindings are available! Enable emacs and vscode bindings in [your editor settings](https://www.val.town/settings/editor) now.
- We've got [a snazzy new trending page](https://val.town/trending) to make it easier to find the hot new vals in town.
- We now lazy-load log lines to make loading large logs more responsive.
- PRs can now be created for README-only changes.
- Images can be pasted into straight into READMEs and comments.
- Forking vals is much faster than before.
- We're continuously tweaking copilot to make it perform better.
- Lots of bugs have been squashed!
