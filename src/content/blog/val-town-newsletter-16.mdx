It's been over two months since our last update and boy have things changed since then! In this newsletter we'll be talking about Val Town's recent funding round, how that's changed the team and our priorities and, of course, the amazing work that our community has been building on Val Town.

Prefer video? This newsletter has a video talkthrough as well.

## Val Town's Seed Round

You might have seen it already on this blog, but this month [Val Town raised $5.5m](https://blog.val.town/blog/seed/) in a round led by Accel. We've also gained Dan Levine on our board, someone we couldn't have built Val Town without.
TODO: write a better line above

We want Val Town to be a place where your ideas are so fast and easy to turn into reality that you can whip them up in minutes without worrying about any future concerns. Your ideas are already productionised from the second you write your first line of code.
Doing that with the quality that we're happy with is no mean feat and it's going to take us some time. This round of funding means that we can focus on Val Town being around long-term and make sustainable, revenue-backed choices in [close collaboration with you, our community](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions).

To get a better idea of how that's already happening, there's much more below.


### Hiring

First things first, we'd like to give a big welcome to Max, the newest member of the Val Town team.
TODO: write something about Max.

    [Max](https://maxmcd.com/), [Steve](https://stevekrouse.com/),
    [Tom](https://macwright.com/), [Andr√©](https://www.andreterron.com/)
  </figcaption>
</div>

You might have seen him on the Discord as @maxmcd already, fixing bugs and working on some of our most requested features.

If you'd like to be part of our growing team, we're hiring a design engineer and generalist engineer in Brooklyn. [Join us!](https://www.val.town/careers)

### Code Search and Performance Improvements

Two of our most wanted features, both by the team and the community, are [Better Search](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/69) and [Better Performance](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113).
Unfortunately, there are no quick fixes here. Fortunately, we have two fantastic people working on them and they're making some great progress that we wanted to update everyone on.

You might have seen the fruits of Tom's labour already; he published [Code Search is Hard](https://blog.val.town/blog/search-notes/) and it went straight to the front page of Hacker News!
We want to get Code Search right. It's an integral part of making vals easier to find, share and re-use, so we're investing a lot of time into finding the right solution.
We've experimented with a number of options already but finding that sweet spot isn't easy. For more details, check out [Tom's original post](https://blog.val.town/blog/search-notes/).
