We announced our seed round, welcomed [Max](https://maxmcd.com/) to our team, launched some small and medium-sized features, made significant progress on bigger ones, and seen some amazing vals from the community.

Coming soon: a redesign of the val page and big performance improvements.

## üå± Val Town's Seed Round

[Val Town raised $5.5m](https://blog.val.town/blog/seed/) in a round led by Accel. Our mission is end-user programming. Everyone should be able to build software, tailor apps to their needs, and automate their lives.

We want to make it so fast and fun to solve problems with code that you actually ship all those wonderful ideas you have to improve things for yourself, communities, and workplace. We‚Äôre building the place where you write the first line of code that becomes your next side project, internal tool, or startup.

## ü§ó Welcome Max!

We are thrilled to welcome [Max McDonnell](https://maxmcd.com/) to the team! Max is joining us from Voltus, where he was most recently a Staff Software Engineer, and formerly Director of Engineering. Max is extremely passionate about simplifying cloud development. In his free time, he's built three ([1](https://github.com/maxmcd/gitbao), [2](https://github.com/embly/embly), [3](https://github.com/maxmcd/256kb.cloud)) FaaS prototypes! We're pumped to have him on the team. Expect things to run faster very soonf.

We're hiring a design engineer and generalist engineer in Brooklyn. [**Join us!**](https://www.val.town/careers)

## What's new in Val Town

### ü¶æ Codeium Completions

<div align="center">
  <Image src={Codeium} alt="The Codeium code completion agent completes a snippet of code on Val Town" />
  <figcaption style="margin-top: -20px;">
    Using the new Codeium integration can really speed up your development!
  </figcaption>
</div>

TODO (steve) talk about how much better they are (we haven't officially launched this)

As it turns out, nobody has integrated Codeium into the CodeMirror editor (the open source editor that we use). We love sharing code, it's what Val Town is all about, so [codemirror-codeium](https://github.com/val-town/codemirror-codeium) was born!

### ü§ñ OpenAI in the Standard Library

You can now code with a little bit of ChatGPT with zero setup via [@std/openai](https://docs.val.town/std/openai/). A small amount of OpenAI usage is included free in every Val Town account.

### üîÑ Replay previous inputs

Vals can now be re-triggered by replaying previous inputs. This is a great [community feature request](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/73) that makes testing your vals, especially ones generated by external services, much easier. You'll find a refresh button next to each line of your vals logs to activate this. A big thanks to [@robinsloan](https://www.val.town/u/robinsloan) for suggesting this excellent feature.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Powerbar

<div align="center">
  <Image src={Cmdk} alt="The new powerbar lets you access common actions at the touch of a button." />
  <figcaption style="margin-top: -20px;">
    Creating a new val is only a few keystrokes away with the new powerbar.
  </figcaption>
</div>

Val Town has a new quick menu, where you can take common actions like creating a new val, navigate straight to specific pages or search for vals. Access it by using ‚åò-K or CTRL-K.

### üéì Onboarding page

<div align="center">

    Making Val Town easy for new users is really important to us.

### üîª Downtime

We take downtime extremely seriously. We had our longest downtime ever (about 100 minutes) due to [Render's outage](https://status.render.com/incidents/thmx6pj4xqvl?u=yty96s4ggns1). We talked with Render about it and they're working hard to make sure it doesn't happen again. We will keep an eye on it, and will be looking into ways to make Val Town more resilient.

### Other updates

- You can now link to line ranges in vals using familiar, GitHub-like syntax: https://www.val.town/v/nbbaier/readmeGPT#L20-29
- HTTP vals have a preview with an editable URL, to make previewing your web pages much easier. Thanks go to [@alexmcroberts-hs](https://github.com/alexmcroberts-hs) for this feature request.
- New keybindings are available! Enable emacs and vscode bindings in [your editor settings](https://www.val.town/settings/editor) now.
- We've got [a snazzy new trending page](https://val.town/trending) to make it easier to find the hot new vals in town.
- We now lazy-load log lines to make loading large logs more responsive.
- PRs can now be created for README-only changes.
- Images can be pasted into straight into READMEs and comments.
- Forking vals is faster than before.
- Profile menu & settings redesigned
- New login page (TODO thank suggester from twitter)
- You can format code without save (in the cmd+k menu)
- Lots of bugs have been squashed!

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### Val Page redesign

Vals are rich objects. They have: a name, versions, privacy, readme, type, links, comments, pull requests, forks, references, imports, and likes. We're redesigning val pages to better surface all this information.

### Performance

Max is [on it](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113#discussioncomment-9097473)! We're hopeful that we can reduce val baseline request time from from 300ms to under 100ms, and even bigger improvements to more complex vals, in the next couple of weeks.

### Code Search

[Code search](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/69) is such an integral part of making vals easier to find, share and re-use, so we're investing a lot of time into finding the right solution. We quietly launched a `v2 beta` search (which you can toggle on in the current search UI), but aren't thrilled with it.

Tom wrote a blog post about how [Code Search is Hard](https://blog.val.town/blog/search-notes/) and we've gotten back dozens of suggestions. Thank you all! We'll be working on this in the coming weeks.

_Shoutout to [@pomdtr](https://www.val.town/u/pomdtr), who very quickly showed us [an unexpected way](https://pomdtr-code_search_is_easy.web.val.run/) to search through public vals... by uploading them all the GitHub and using Github's code search!_

### On the roadmap

- Val HTTP streaming
- Code Search
- New pricing
- TODO add more here from github discussions
- TODO (steve) add more from linear
