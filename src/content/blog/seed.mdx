[Val Town](https://www.val.town/pulls/d9b1df70-e2e2-11ee-846a-8aad37b30b4b) is a social website to write and deploy serverless functions. You can create [websites](https://docs.val.town/types/http/jsx/), [APIs](https://docs.val.town/types/http/), and [crons](https://docs.val.town/types/scheduled/) from your browser.

Build [a battle royale for connect4 bots](https://saolsen-connect4_site.web.val.run/), craft [a custom RSS feed](https://www.val.town/v/Glench/googlePhotosMarketingRSS), react to [new subscribers from Stripe](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/newStripeEvent), start your [Subaru's engine](https://www.val.town/v/seep/subaru), generate [SVG badges](https://www.val.town/v/vladimyr/podcastBadge) or [open graph images](https://www.val.town/v/tomcritchlow/tom_og), send [RSS items to Posthog](https://posthog.com/tutorials/rss-item-capture), scrape for when your [sea light swizzles are in stock](https://nateeagle.com/posts/val-town-scraper/), build a [custom newsletter system](https://www.petemillspaugh.com/cultivating-emails), or book [reservations on Resy](https://www.val.town/v/alp/bookReservationOnResy).

I've built [my personal website](https://stevekrouse.com/), [an alternative dating app](https://dateme.directory/), [Discord stand-up bot](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/dailyStandupBot), and a [handful](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/umbrellaReminder) [of](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/BIGweather) [weather](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/weatherGPT) [apps](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/aqi) on Val Town.

{/* TODO - try to polish these apps, and make their READMEs good */}

Our mission is [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/). Everyone should be able to create software.

We believe that code is still the best interface (so far) to build applications. But even if someone knows how to code, they can't ship useful software. There is so much around the code that needs to happen: setting up a development environment, deployment, hosting, scaling, logging, monitoring, version control, persistence...

In Val Town, you open a tab, write code, and hit ⌘s. We handle everything else. We deploy in 100ms, scale up or down as needed, and include the basics of everything you need: logging, monitoring, versions, error tracking, persistence... Programming in Val Town should feel more like [editing a spreadsheet](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1076979937440161793?s=20) (live, fluid, reactive, learnable) than using a traditional IDE. We want to make it so fast and fun to write apps that you’re constantly whipping them up for yourself, your communities, and your workplace.

Community is at the heart of Val Town. We're building a town, not just a tool. We're a social coding platform, with hosting built-in. This means that anyone else's public code is instantly _runnable_ within your own Val Town account. A _fork_ is like an _install_. There's nothing to setup, install, or deploy.

The origins of Val Town can be traced back to my childhood. I was bitten by a radioactive turtle. I was a LOGO kid. I fell in love with this strange “turtle.” I could tell it to `repeat 4[fd 10 rt 90]` and it'd draw a square! ([Try it out for yourself.](https://turtleacademy.com/lessons/11)) The powers this radioactive turtle granted me were subtle but powerful. I became really good at math. It felt like I gained 20 IQ points.

Seymour Papert, the creator of LOGO, had a theory. Mathematics should be learned the same way your native language is learned: through community and play. If French kids learn French simply growing up in France, could kids learn math better by growing up in “Mathland”? He created LOGO to be such a “Mathland” for kids to naturally assimilate powerful mathematical mental models: a debugging mindset, precision, abstraction, modularity, looping, recursion, reasoning from definitions… and a warm, fuzzy feeling of ownership of these skills. For example, I learned to imagine myself in the turtle's shoes and walk out the route I wanted it to follow, and then encode that route into code. A couple years later in high school calculus, I was able to effortlessly assimilate the concept of a derivative as the rate of change: I could just imagine myself walking along the curve and the derivative was my orientation at any point. I could feel it in my bones. To my classmates, it just looked like I was smart. But I was just a kid who had grown up in Mathland.

Val Town is not an educational tool. It's a pro tool for building real software. But we are designing it to be [learnable](https://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) by everyone. Eventually including non-programmers and kids. We're already welcoming to new programmers. Some of our best users barely knew how to code when they made their first val. Like the spreadsheet, Val Town will be where beginners get their start _and_ big companies run core infrastructure. Come for the code hosting, stay for the community, and become smarter along the way. Software is eating the world. If creating software is made accessible enough, the whole world becomes “Codeland”, and the powerful mental models I learned in childhood are accessible to everyone. It's a step towards what Alan Kay calls the “real computer revolution.”

Today we're announcing our $5.5m seed, led by [Dan Levine](https://www.accel.com/people/daniel-levine) at Accel. Dan has been a spiritual cofounder for Val Town since before the first line of code. He led our $1.5m pre-seed in August 2022 and is now joining our board.

We are excited to have so many heroes, role models, friends, and advisors joining our cap table. It takes a ~~village~~ town: Tom Preston-Warner, Guillermo Rauch, James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, David Cramer, Simon Last, Calvin French-Owen, Matthew McClure, Zapier's Investment Fund, Tod Sacerdoti, Cristina Cordova, Matt Brezina, Ben Vinegar, Chet Corcos, Devon Zuegel, Sebastian Bensusan, Linus Lee, Michelle Lim, Dan Shipper, Shawn @swyx Wang, Meagan Gamache, Yasyf Mohamedali, Daniel Marcotte, Nick Arner, and Jordan Scales.

We're a team of 4 that ships quickly and dreams big. [Come join us!](https://www.val.town/careers)
