Today we're announcing our $5.5m seed round led by [Dan Levine](https://www.accel.com/people/daniel-levine) at Accel. Dan has been a spiritual cofounder for Val Town since before the first line of code. Dan led our $1.5m pre-seed in August 2022, and is now joining our board.

[Val Town](https://www.val.town/pulls/d9b1df70-e2e2-11ee-846a-8aad37b30b4b) is a social website to write and deploy serverless functions. You can create [websites](https://docs.val.town/types/http/jsx/), [APIs](https://docs.val.town/types/http/), and [crons](https://docs.val.town/types/scheduled/) from your browser. For example, you could:

- Scrape for when your [sea light swizzles are in stock](https://nateeagle.com/posts/val-town-scraper/)
- Toot your [latest blog posts to Mastodon](https://sebastiandedeyne.com/tags/val-town)
- Send [RSS items to Posthog](https://posthog.com/tutorials/rss-item-capture)
- Generate [SVG badges](https://www.val.town/v/vladimyr/podcastBadge) or [open graph images](https://www.val.town/v/tomcritchlow/tom_og)
- Build a [face swaping app](https://replicate.com/guides/hypermedia/build-hypermedia-app) with Replicate

Our mission is [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/). Everyone should be able to code.

We believe that code is still the best interface (so far) to build applications. But knowing how to code isn't enough for someone to ship useful software. There is so much around the code that needs to happen: setting up a development environment, setting up a deployment environment, scaling, logging, monitoring, version control, persistence, etc.

In Val Town, you write code and hit save. Your code is immediately deployed. Basic versions of everything are right at hand: logging, monitoring, versions, error tracking, persistence, scaling, and more. Every Val Town account comes with a hosted [SQLite](https://docs.val.town/std/sqlite/) database, [blob](https://docs.val.town/std/blob/) storage, the ability to [send](https://docs.val.town/std/email/) and [receive](https://docs.val.town/types/email/) emails, and limited [OpenAI](https://docs.val.town/std/openai/) access. Everything you need, right at your fingertips.

If we don't include something, likely someone in Val Town community has already built and shared it. You can just import it. We're a social coding platform, with hosting built-in. Anyone else's public code is instantly runnable within your own account. A fork is like an install. There's nothing to setup, install, or deploy.

[Nico](https://www.val.town/u/nbbaier)'s [SQLite Explorer](https://www.val.town/v/nbbaier/sqliteExplorerApp) is a good example of our community at play. It's a handy admin view for your built-in SQLite database. The val imports from dozens of other vals, from [@postpostscript](https://www.val.town/v/postpostscript/sqliteBuilder), [@pomdtr](https://www.val.town/v/pomdtr/password_auth), and [@andreterron](https://www.val.town/v/andreterron/codeOnValTown).

I found this list of dependencies by – you guessed it – another community val, [Robert](https://www.val.town/u/rlesser)'s [Dependency Graph Viewer](https://rlesser-dependency_graph.web.val.run/).

Programming in Val Town should feel more like editing a spreadsheet (live, fluid, reactive, learnable) than using a traditional IDE. We want to make it so fast, fun, and collaborative to write apps that you're constantly whipping them up for yourself, communities, and workplace.

I fell in love with programming as a kid. LOGO is a programming language that lets you control a turtle on the screen. You can make it move forward, turn, and draw lines. I still remember the feeling of empowerment when I figured out how to draw a square.

</div>

Seymour Papert, the creator of LOGO, had a theory. If French kids learn French simply growing up in France, could kids learn math better by growing up in “Mathland”? He created LOGO to be such a “Mathland” for kids to naturally assimilate powerful mental models: a debugging mindset, precision, abstraction, modularity, looping, recursion, reasoning from definitions, etc, and a warm feeling of ownership of these skills.

I learned to imagine myself in the turtle's shoes and walk out the route I wanted it to follow, and then encode that route into code. Later in calculus, I was able to effortlessly assimilate the concept of a derivative: I imagined myself walking along the curve, and the derivative just was my orientation at any point. To my classmates, it looked like I was smart. But I was just a kid who had grown up in Mathland. I've long dreamed of building my own Mathland and a programming environment that shares the love I have for programming.

Val Town is not an educational tool. It's a pro tool for building real software. But it is designed to be [learnable](https://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). Like the spreadsheet, Val Town is where beginners start _and_ big companies run core infrastructure. Come for the code hosting, stay for the community, and become smarter along the way.

We are excited to have so many heroes, friends, and advisors joining our cap table. It takes a ~~village~~ town: Tom Preston-Warner, Guillermo Rauch, James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, David Cramer, Simon Last, Calvin French-Owen, Matthew McClure, Zapier's Investment Fund, Tod Sacerdoti, Cristina Cordova, Matt Brezina, Ben Vinegar, Chet Corcos, Devon Zuegel, Sebastian Bensusan, Linus Lee, Michelle Lim, Dan Shipper, Shawn @swyx Wang, Meagan Gamache, Yasyf Mohamedali, Daniel Marcotte, Nick Arner, and Jordan Scales.

We're a small team that ships quickly and dreams big.
