We shipped HTTP streaming, semantic search, and Townie, an AI chatbot that knows how to write vals. We released a TypeScript SDK and OpenAPI spec for the Val Town API. We redesigned profiles, public likes, and named API tokens.

We're working on making it easier to organize and navigate vals, along with improvements to search, Townie and other LLM experiments, and the ability to stop a running val.

Community vals - TODO summary

If you enjoy reading these newsletters so much that you'd like to write them, we're [hiring a content-focused devrel person](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1805316371804569626) at Val Town. I think it's a very fun job! (I'm biased.)

### üåä HTTP Streaming

You can stream data from vals! Our new [open-sourced HTTP worker](https://github.com/val-town/deno-http-worker) enables us to increase request size limits from 2mb to 100mb and make response sizes unlimited. Read more in the [HTTP Streaming announcement](/blog/http-streaming/).

## Val Semantic Search

We have a new search mode that uses OpenAI embeddings to give you a val with the same "vibes" as your search query. It's currently its own mode labelled "semantic search" ‚Äì [try it out yourself!](https://www.val.town/search?searchType=semantic) We're planning to combine it with the exact search to give you a wholistic search experience. Learn more in the [Semantic Search announcement](/blog/val-vibes/).

## Townie

We built a toy little chatbot, Townie, that's basically ChatGPT that knows a bunch of common Val Town patterns. Pretty good at generating working code. You can see below me asking it for help on a fairly complex task [from Pat LaVarre](https://x.com/pelavarre/status/1804191746760544676). It doesn't give me what I ask for ‚Äì it gives me something better ‚Äì that immediately worked. And it did it zero-shot (on its first try). It works even better if you give it feedback in a couple iterations. [Try it out!](https://www.val.town/townie)

## TypeScript SDK

After a herculean effort to port our Express server to Fastify with good type annotations, we were able to generate a good OpenAPI schema, which we then used to generate a TypeScript SDK via Stainless.

TODO links to github and npm and val town demo - maybe a video demo on val town with types would be nice

## Profile redesign, public likes

Your profile page is now prettier and a bit more functional. You can view your vals in a list or a grid, as well as the vals you liked. We're reimagining your profile as a jumping off point to explore your vals. Coming soon: sorting and filtering for vals in your profile.

## üì∫ Livestreams

Livestreams are a great way to learn Val Town by watching others use it. And if you watch live, you can ask questions and we'll answer! Or heckle. That's fun too.

Steve started a weekly live coding series. Since the last newsletter, I spoke with:
