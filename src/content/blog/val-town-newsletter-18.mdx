Over the last month, we shipped HTTP streaming, val semantic search, and Townie, an AI chatbot that knows how to write vals. We also released a shiny TypeScript SDK and OpenAI spec for the Val Town API, redesigned profiles, public likes, named API tokens, and more.

We're currently working on more search improvements, a side panel for folders & vals, stopping a running val, and usage tracking.

Community vals - TODO summary

If you enjoy reading these newsletters so much that you'd like to write them, we're [hiring a content-focused devrel person](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1805316371804569626) at Val Town. I think it's a very fun job! (I'm biased.)

### üåä HTTP Streaming

You can stream data from vals! Our new [open-sourced HTTP worker](https://github.com/val-town/deno-http-worker) enables us to increase request size limits from 2mb to 100mb and make response sizes unlimited. Read more in the [HTTP Streaming announcement](/blog/http-streaming/).

## Val Semantic Search

We have a new search mode that uses OpenAI embeddings to give you a val with the same "vibes" as your search query. It's currently its own mode labelled "semantic search" ‚Äì [try it out yourself!](https://www.val.town/search?searchType=semantic) We're planning to combine it with the exact search to give you a wholistic search experience. Learn more in the [Semantic Search announcement](/blog/val-vibes/).

## Townie

We built a toy little chatbot, Townie, that's basically ChatGPT that knows a bunch of common Val Town patterns. Pretty good at generating working code. You can see below me asking it for help on a fairly complex task [from Pat LaVarre](https://x.com/pelavarre/status/1804191746760544676). It doesn't give me what I ask for ‚Äì it gives me something better ‚Äì that immediately worked. And it did it zero-shot (on its first try). It works even better if you give it feedback in a couple iterations. [Try it out!](https://www.val.town/townie)

## TypeScript SDK

After a herculean effort to port our Express server to Fastify with good type annotations, we were able to generate a good OpenAPI schema, which we then used to generate a TypeScript SDK via Stainless.

TODO links to github and npm and val town demo - maybe a video demo on val town with types would be nice

## Profile redesign, public likes

Your profile page is now prettier and a bit more functional. You can view your vals in a list or a grid, as well as the vals you liked. We're reimagining your profile as a jumping off point to explore your vals. Coming soon: sorting and filtering for vals in your profile.

## üì∫ Livestreams

Livestreams are a great way to learn Val Town by watching others use it. And if you watch live, you can ask questions and we'll answer! Or heckle. That's fun too.

Steve started a weekly live coding series. Since the last newsletter, I spoke with:
