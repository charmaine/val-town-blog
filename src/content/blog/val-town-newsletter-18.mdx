Over the last month, we shipped HTTP streaming, val semantic search, and Townie, our AI chatbot. We also released a shiny TypeScript SDK for the Val Town API, redesigned profiles, public likes, named API tokens, and more.

We're currently working on more search improvements, a side panel for folders & vals, stopping a running val, and usage tracking.

Community vals - TODO summary

### üåä HTTP Streaming

You can stream data from vals! Our new [open-sourced HTTP worker](https://github.com/val-town/deno-http-worker) enables us to increase request size limits from 2mb to 100mb and make response sizes unlimited. Read more in the [HTTP Streaming announcement](/blog/http-streaming/).

## Val Semantic Search

We have a new search mode that uses OpenAI embeddings to give you a val with the same "vibes" as your search query. It's currently its own mode labelled "semantic search" ‚Äì [try it out yourself!](https://www.val.town/search?searchType=semantic) We're planning to combine it with the exact search to give you a wholistic search experience. Learn more in the [Semantic Search announcement](/blog/val-vibes/).

## Townie

We built our own AI chatbot, Townie, using a novel backpropagation algorith combined with a new concept similar to attention that supports large context windows... Okay, okay, it's just pre-prompted chatgpt. [Try it out!](https://www.val.town/townie)

## TypeScript SDK

After a herculean effort to port our Express server to Fastify with good type annotations, we were able to generate a good OpenAPI schema, which we then used to generate a TypeScript SDK via Stainless.

TODO links to github and npm and val town demo - maybe a video demo with types would be nice

## Profile redesign, public likes

Your profile page is now a bit prettier and more functional. You can view your vals in a list or a grid, as well as the vals you liked. We're reimagining your profile as a jumping off point to explore your vals. Coming soon is sorting and filtering for vals in your profile.

## üì∫ Livestreams

They're a great way to learn Val Town by watching others use it. And if you watch live, you can ask questions and we'll answer! Or heckle. That's fun too.

Steve started a weekly live coding series. Since the last newsletter, I spoke with:
