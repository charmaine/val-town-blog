The JavaScript ecosystem has changed a lot in the last 15 years.
We've gone from CommonJS to ESM, from browserify to webpack to vite,
from mocha to vitest, from the request module to using web-standard
fetch everywhere. The constant reinvention can
be exciting or annoying from one day to the next.

### The success of Express

Amid all this churn, [express][express] has persevered.
Express is a web framework for Node.js, introduced
by [TJ Holowaychuk][tj] in 2009. Like many early JavaScript
modules and some of TJ's projects, it took inspiration
from the land of Ruby - in particular, [Sinatra][sinatra], which
was established in 2007.

```js title="express-example.js"
// This is a tiny example of using
// express. Notice how there's almost no boilerplate
// involved in creating a tiny web server.
const app = require('express')();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});
app.listen(3000);
```

Express is a beautifully light abstraction: a
'hello world' example is barely over 10 lines. Compared to the boilerplate
required to do the same in Ruby on Rails or a Java server at the time, it
was a breath of fresh air.

Express became the default for new JavaScript projects and has stayed
there. In a typical week, express is downloaded from NPM 30 million
times. It's a roaring success in every way.

### A need for types

Express is an _expressive_ framework: like a classic Ruby or
JavaScript framework, it lets you color outside the lines using
loosely defined objects and types. Query string parameters in express
become [freeform objects](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query).
The same goes for the bodies of requests, and the kinds of responses
you can send: it's all a bit ad-hoc by default.

But the vibes have shifted: we write [TypeScript][ts] now,
and everyone's excited about validation modules like [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
and [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox). Interfaces
are less ad-hoc and more declared, tested, and strictly typed.

Modern tooling is written to take full advantage of types
and schemas. With [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), we're writing backend
endpoints and calling them from auto-generated, auto-typed functions
on the frontend. Other backends are embracing [OpenAPI][openapi]
(nÃ©e Swagger) to generate clients, test suites, and more.
End-to-end type-safety is in vogue, and it is good.

### The promise of OpenAPI

In our case, we want our types as an [OpenAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification)
specification.
OpenAPI is a JSON/YAML document that lets you describe your entire
REST API strictly: what URLs are supported, how parameters, headers,
and request bodies should be formatted, what kind of responses
will be produced. It lets you enrich this strict machine-readable
information with human-readable descriptions and helpful examples.
It's a pretty exciting time for the OpenAPI spec.

```

A number of companies and open source projects, including
[Stainless](https://www.stainlessapi.com/), [Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/),
and [OpenAPI TypeScript](https://openapi-ts.pages.dev/), are
writing tools that can generate functional, clean SDKs straight
from OpenAPI specifications.

You can also generate great documentation from OpenAPI specifications.
We're already [generating api.val.town/documentation][openapi_docs]
using a library from [Scalar](https://scalar.com/).

And in the near future, we should be able to use our OpenAPI specification
to give our [AI assistant](https://x.com/tmcw/status/1803132938269175956)
the ability to interact with our API via [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling):
conveniently, OpenAPI and the OpenAI function calling
system are both based on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/),
so translating between the two is possible.

###  Issues with express

Val Town started off with Express. It has served us pretty well.
But the papercuts started to accumulate.

When we started creating  [a public API with an OpenAPI spec][rfc],
we immediately started to get a bad feeling about using express
as we were doing before. The OpenAPI specification was making
strong promises about the kinds of requests we accepted and responses
we'd return. But the specification was just a dead document,
a YAML file - it wasn't part our codebase, or our test suite. So it
wasn't enforced or validated, and sure enough, it was slightly incorrect
from day one.

The other pain point was async. We write the Val Town backend
as TypeScript but try to transpile it to modern code, so
we keep our [async functions][async_mdn] and ESM syntax when we
run our code. Express far predates the existence of the
async & await keywords in JavaScript, and it [does not mix well with them][express_async].

### Finding an alternative

Because express is incredibly popular, there are ways to implement
OpenAPI with it, and support async handlers - plugins like
[express-openapi](https://github.com/kogosoftwarellc/open-api)
and [express-async-errors](https://github.com/davidbanham/express-async-errors). But these are a bit bolted-on:
they make it technically possible to achieve the goal, but
nothing about them is idiomatic.

Another option would be waiting for the next version of express, v5,
which includes support for async functions. That release is
taking [a little while to complete][express_5], so we didn't want
to bet on it landing soon.

It is great, though, that express
is still actively maintained, and I don't envy the task of rolling
a major update to such a heavily-adopted project. There are certainly
codebases with tens of thousands of lines of code that rely on
express and can't easily jump to an alternative.

But Val Town's backend is not an enormous legacy project.
Switching web frameworks wasn't going to require
a [deadly from-scratch rewrite][never_rewrite]. We were ready to
bid adieu to express.

Technology choice is complicated. I don't want to make a decision
based on some simplistic criteria like GitHub Stars, but it's equally
fraught to rely on vibes and instinct. So I investigated whether
projects had good documentation and maintainership, if they had
a decent history of stability, and perhaps most importantly, whether
they were trying to solve the problems that we needed to solve.

### Fastify

![Fastify](./fastify/fastify-logo.png)

We landed on [fastify][fastify] as the technology to build the
future of Val Town's public API. Some of the strongest points for
fastify were:

- A comprehensive [ecosystem](https://fastify.dev/ecosystem/),
  which includes a lot of high-quality, first-party plugins. We're
  building a system in production, which means things like rate
  limiting are going to be necessary, and it's amazing that
  fastify's [rate limiter](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-rate-limit)
  is well-architected.
- Great, thorough [documentation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/),
  and an active community that has been really helpful for support.
- Solid support for [plugins and encapsulation](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Encapsulation/) that let us structure the application into sub-applications.
- Support for [validation and serialization](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Validation-and-Serialization/) with multiple validators and validation for all inputs and ouputs.
- [Good support for async/await](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Reference/Routes/#async-await), like you might expect from a modern framework.
- Off-the-shelf integrations for [opentelemetry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fastify) and [Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/fastify/) mean
  that we could have tracing and telemetry from day one.
- We were already using the [light-my-request](https://github.com/fastify/light-my-request) module to test
  our express server. light-my-request is written and maintained
  by the fastify folks, and it is built into fastify.
- Finally, [@fastify/express](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-express)
    let us incrementally migrate from express to fastify.

Of course, fastify is also very fast, but web framework overhead
wasn't a problem with express and most likely won't be a problem with
any framework we choose: most of our performance envelope has to
do with operating [the Val Town runtime][runtimes] and interacting
with the database.

We considered a few other options, like [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/).
Both are lovely projects - we use and recommend Hono a ton
in Vals. Elysia has convenient typesafety and a lot of features,
but its support for Node.js is very experimental. And Hono has
a [first-party OpenAPI plugin](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi), but some of the ecosystem around fastify - for tracing,
incremental migration from express, and plugins - was more built-out.

For simpler projects and especially for situations where we want
multi-platform compatibility so that code can run on Node.js, Deno,
or Cloudflare Workers, [we reach for Hono](https://www.val.town/examples/packages/hono).

### Incrementally porting our application, route by route

By using [@fastify/express](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-express)
we were able to do this migration entirely incrementally: the first
fastify PR just added the fastify dependency and wrapped our express
server with fastify. Then each successive PR moved a few routes
from express to fastify, until the application has been
completely ported.

<IssuesChart />

As of today, we've ported all but two routes in our backend server.
It's been an incredibly incremental effort, thanks to @fastify/express -
such that we never had to stop work on feature development or freeze
part of the codebase while switching frameworks.

And the best is yet to come âÂ next we'll be talking about our
[new TypeScript SDK][sdk], which is generated directly from the OpenAPI
documents that fastify produces, as well as [improved documentation](https://api.val.town/documentation)
and more robust API endpoints. Stay tuned!
