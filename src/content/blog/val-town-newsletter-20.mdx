The newest version of Townie is _incredible_ at writing vals. You can create fully working apps with a frontend, backend, and database ‚Äì without even knowing how to code ‚Äì in minutes. Honestly, if you have five minutes, you gotta try it out!

But don't let Townie entirely steal the show. We deployed a new load balancer that make vals run up to 10x faster. We also rolled out lockfiles to to your vals for security, stability, and speed. We shipped a dozen other features and bug fixes, too.

TODO - something about community vals
