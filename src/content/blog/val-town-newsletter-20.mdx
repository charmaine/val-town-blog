The newest version of Townie is _incredible_ at writing vals. It creates deployed apps with a backend and database in seconds. Honestly, if you have five minutes, [you gotta try it out](https://val.town/townie)!

We shipped a number of other improvements, including a huge speedup to vals, lockfiles to secure your code, the ability to receive email attachments, a new version history UI, and opened up support for hundreds more NPM packages.

Quick hiring update: we're still looking for a couple more engineers to join our founding team. If you have any brilliant friends in NYC, please send them our way!

There was such an overwhelming amount of amazing vals created this month that I had to [build a custom tool](TODO) to help me write the "community vals" section of this newsletter. You guys rock!

## ü§ñ Townie AI

This month we released our third wholesale rewrite of Townie, and it's _incredible_. It's now able to generate full-stack applications with a backend and database in seconds. It's like Claude Artifacts, with a backend.
