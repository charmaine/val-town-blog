The newest version of Townie is _incredible_ at writing vals. You can create fully working apps with a frontend, backend, and database ‚Äì without even knowing how to code ‚Äì in minutes. Honestly, if you have five minutes, you gotta try it out!

We also deployed a new load balancer that make vals run up to 10x faster. We rolled out lockfiles to to your vals for security, stability, and speed. We shipped a dozen other features and bug fixes, too.
