Last month, we launched a major overhaul of Townie, our AI code assistant that helps you build apps. Val Town is already the best place to turn an idea into a deployed app. Townie gets you there in minutes.

## Townie in Action

{/* TODO: a GIF of a basic Townie interaction a la the one at the beginning of our codegen article */}

In the following video, I use Townie to make an RSVP page. In just a few prompts and a couple minutes, I create a deployed apps with a frontend, backend, and SQLite database. No joke!

But the best way to see what Townie is like is to just go play with it.

## ðŸ”¥ Examples from the community

Your creativity never ceases to amaze us. Here are some of the cool things built with Townie so far.

#### Blog summaries

With a hand full of prompts, Peter made a neat tool to get Claude to summarize a blog post just by pasting a link.
