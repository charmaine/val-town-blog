Last month, we launched a major overhaul of Townie, our AI assistant that helps you build apps. Val Town was already the best website to turn an idea into a deployed app. Townie can help you ship much faster.

In the following video, I use Townie to make an RSVP page – with a backend and database – in just a few prompts and a couple minutes.

But the best way to see what Townie is like is to just go play with it.
