### New OG Image for vals

Jackson shipped a new OG image for vals

TODO photo https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1791126791341449250

TODO - you can create OG images in vals!

### Fixer for JSX Pragma

Val Town supports any kind of JSX. The problem is you have to specify which kind of JSX (React, Preact, Vue, Hono, etc) at the top of the val in this hard to remember pragma, ie for React it's `/** @jsxImportSource https://esm.sh/react */`. Tom shipped a fixer that detects the missing pragma when you use JSX and helps you add it in.
