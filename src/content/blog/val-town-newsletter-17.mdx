Over the last month, we drastically improved val runtime performance, redesigned the val page, and worked on dozens of other improvements and bug fixes. Jackson and JP joined the team! Steve started a weekly live coding series.

Now we're working on HTTP streaming and improving user onboarding. Over the coming weeks and months, we'll work on better search, improved val organization, a new pricing plan, more performance improvements, and more.

### ü§ó Welcome Jackson & JP!

We're excited to welcome Jackson and JP to the team!

[Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/) was most recently an indie game designer, and before that a Staff Engineer at Gatsby. He's known for [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/), [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/), and [MDX Deck](https://mdxjs.com/). He's joining full-time as our founding design engineer.

[JP](https://janpaulposma.nl/) was most recently uncovering ancient Roman secrets at [Scroll Prize](https://scrollprize.org/), and before that founded [Zaplib](https://zaplib.com/) with Steve. He is joining part-time for the summer.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Vals are 2x faster!

Max shipped [a huge performance improvement](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/113#discussioncomment-9203997) to the val runtime by cutting out a network hop on imports. Vals are at least 60% faster. Vals with many imports are many times faster. For example, the [Date Me Directory](https://dateme.directory) (one of the most complex vals) runs 6x faster now ‚Äì 0.5 second vs 3 seconds! There's more to do to make vals even faster, but this is a great start.

### üé® Val Page Redesign

Tom redesigned the val page to make it easier to parse and navigate: [Redesigning Val Pages](/blog/redesigning-val-pages/).

### üì∫ Livestreams

Steve started a weekly live coding series. Tune into the next episodes:

- [Max Bittker ‚Äì May 30, 12pm ET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QGjdDGEkyI)
- [Linus Lee ‚Äì June 6, 12pm ET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nYPeK9_X6o)

</a>

They're a great way to learn Val Town by watching others use it. And if you watch live, you can ask questions and we'll answer! The first three episodes:

- [Jamie Dubs (@jamiew)](https://www.youtube.com/live/-HZyIm3Nlvo?feature=shared)
- [Jordan Scales (@jdan)](https://www.youtube.com/live/zbl5KHf7_YY?feature=shared)
- [Lu Wilson (@todepond)](https://www.youtube.com/live/5Em6D7n-ggs?feature=shared)

This series was inspired by Steve's livestreams with [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WnOcLog2P1Y) and [Maggie Appleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJTeyskdYpk), which are also recommended watching! Jason's episode is great for pro JavaScripters who want to see us accomplish a lot in a short time. Maggie's episode is great for front-end engineers who want to learn backend programming.

### üìù Quickstarts

We wrote two quickstart tutorials to help you make your first vals. Let us know if you get stuck!

1. [Your first cron val](https://docs.val.town/quickstarts/first-cron/) - a personalized weather email every morning
2. [Your first website val](https://docs.val.town/quickstarts/first-website/) - a link in bio website template you can fork and customize

### üñºÔ∏è New OG Share Image

Jackson shipped a much improved OpenGraph share image for vals for when you share a val link with a friend ‚Äì which you should all do every day ‚Äì I hear it's good for the soul.

  <Image src={OGImage} alt="New OG share image" />

### JSX Pragma Helper

Val Town supports any kind of JSX. This is a blessing and a curse. The problem is you have to specify which kind of JSX (React, Preact, Hono, etc) at the top of the val in this hard to remember pragma. For example, for React it's `/** @jsxImportSource https://esm.sh/react */`. Tom shipped a fixer that detects the missing pragma when you use JSX and helps you add it in.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

### What we're working on

Max is almost done rewriting our core networking code to make HTTP streaming possible. This will also improve performance for HTTP vals and pave the way for websocket support.

The rest of the team has been focused increasing signups, improving user onboarding, and making usability improvements. We're making user interviews a regular part of every Val Town employee's job. They really impact what we work on. If you want to have a personalized onboarding or a voice in the future of Val Town, email [interviews@val.town](mailto:interviews@val.town) and we'll set up a time to chat!
