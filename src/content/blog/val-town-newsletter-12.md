We‚Äôre [on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/val-town)! Please show
us some
love¬†[by leaving a review](https://www.producthunt.com/products/val-town/reviews/new)
‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

August was a busy month! We announced our plans for the Runtime v3, totally
revamped how you build API endpoints on Val Town with our new web-standard Web
API, added another column on desktop so you can view multiple vals side-by-side,
‚Äúpublic but unlisted‚Äù vals for private-ish use-cases, TypeScript intelligence
generally available, notifications when folks comment or like your vals, the
ability to properly fork vals, dark mode, and many more features and fixes, a
bunch of tutorials, blogs, video, podcasts, and did I mention
[we‚Äôre live on Product Hunt right now](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/val-town)?

### Val Town is on Product Hunt

If you‚Äôre reading this on Sept 5th, then we would
[love your support on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/val-town)!
Show off some of your cool vals, tell a story, or give us some feedback. We‚Äôd
really appreciate you helping new folks discover us

### Blogs, podcasts, tutorials

### Runtime v3 is in development

We recently wrote about
[issues with our current runtime, and how the v3 runtime is going to correct them.](https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-runtime-v3-my-mistakes-were-easy-the-solutions-simple)
We‚Äôre moving away from custom JavaScript features in favor standard JavaScript,
made delightful with editor support. What was implicit and magical will become
explicit and robust ‚Äî but keeping the magical ~~vibes~~ without the headaches.

A snippet of code from the current v2 runtime:

```tsx
let result = await console.email(result);
```

Our plan for the v3 runtime:

```tsx
import { fetchJSON } from "vt/stevekrouse/fetchJSON";
import { email } from "vt/std/email";

let result = await fetchJSON("...");
email(result);
```

You‚Äôll notice the absence of the `@` symbol and standard imports (via import
maps).
[Read more here](https://blog.val.town/blog/val-town-runtime-v3-my-mistakes-were-easy-the-solutions-simple),
and let us know what you think. We know we‚Äôre removing some of your favorite
features, but we are confident we can replace them with web-standard equivalents
that you‚Äôll like just as much or more!

### Ain‚Äôt No Party Like A JavaScript Party

We featured on a recent episode of JSParty and talked about all things Val Town
including where the idea came from, how vals are discovered and interact and our
tech stack.

### Steve on Scaling Devtools

My podcast tour finishes up strong with an episode with Jack Bridger, focused a
bit more on the business side of things.

### Discord Bot Tutorial

We‚Äôve been making it easier than ever to get started hosting a Discord bot on
Val Town. We now have
[a new tutorial](https://docs.val.town/discord-bot-that-replies-to-slash-commands)
and video.

#### Handling `<form>` data

We released a quick tutorial about handling HTML Form data using vals, which is
perfect for static sites.

#### Val Town ü§ù¬†GPT

We wrote a guide on
[fine-tuning a ChatGPT-3.5](https://blog.val.town/blog/an-introduction-to-openai-fine-tuning)
model for use in your own domains. It‚Äôs not quite the right time for Val Town to
head in this direction, but we‚Äôre actively working on getting LLMs to help you
write vals.

### Changelog

#### Web API

We released our new [Web API](https://docs.val.town/api/web), the future of
building servers on Val Town. A Val conforms to the Web API interface when it:

1. accepts a [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/request)
2. returns a
   [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/response)

That‚Äôs it! We love it and we think it‚Äôs a huge step forwards towards building
Vals that adhere to web standards and run anywhere.

Here are a couple of examples to see how simple yet powerful it can be:

<div class="not-content">
  <iframe src="https://www.val.town/embed/tmcw.jsonOkExample" width="100%" frameborder="no" style="height: 400px;">
    &#x20;

    &#x20;
  </iframe>
</div>

#### Unlisted Vals

For your vals that need to be open to the internet but not discoverable on Val
Town by anyone, we have the new ‚ÄúUnlisted‚Äù mode. This complements the Private
and Public modes and can be changed using the same switch.

![Untitled](./val-town-newsletter-12/untitled.png)

#### Sidebar & Val Previews

There was a lot of feedback on our New Val button, and how it opens up in a
modal that obscure other vals. We took that feedback to heart, and Tom
prototyped a bunch of other solutions, and we finally landed on one we‚Äôre really
happy with:

1. Preview of vals when hovering over @references
2. Pinning vals to a sidebar (from the preview or the ‚Ä¶ menu)

The pinned vals column is resizable by dragging its border. Note that this is
desktop-only, since there‚Äôs not quite enough room for two panes on a phone.

#### Types for everyone

We recently added TypeScript editor support, but it was buggy and slow, so we
kept it as an opt-in beta feature. However, we polished it up, and moved it to a
web worker, freeing up the main thread to keep our UI nice and snappy. We moved
it out of beta, so now everyone will get lovely type support throughout Val
Town.

#### Val Templates

Now when you create a new val, you get a handy list of templates to get you
started. We‚Äôre particularly excited for how this can help new users discover
what they can make in Val Town. This feature also foreshadows one of our most
exciting UI improvements coming soon‚Ä¶

#### Notifications

We‚Äôre building out proper notification infrastructure. We‚Äôve got comments,
likes, and references so far. Look out for forks, mentions, and errors ‚Äî as well
as push notifications via email & webhook coming soon!

#### Email _anyone_ from Val Town

Val Town Pro users can now email _anyone_ from Val Town. This
opens up lots of possibilities for creating more dynamic services on Val Town.
Check out [`@std.email`](https://www.val.town/v/std.email), and these
[email](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse.emailGPT3)
[bots](https://www.val.town/v/andreterron.dallemail) for ideas. This val is a
small taste of how we‚Äôll make APIs like console.email web standard. It‚Äôs a bit
clunky at the moment, but we have lots of ideas on how to improve it.

#### READMEs and Comments get images and references

A picture paints a thousand words, so keep your READMEs and comments easy to
understand by adding some with our new drag-and-drop image functionality.

#### Fork vals

At long last, you can _*properly*_ fork a val, and have its provenance tracked
in the database. Before we just added a `// Forked from @someones.val` comment
at the bottom of forked vals. We also migrated as many of those old-style forked
vals over as possible. Now a forked val has a little icon in the bottom left of
the val. You can also fork your own val ‚Äî the option to do so is in the _‚Ä¶_
menu.

#### Dark mode

Val Town now has Dark mode! There‚Äôs also Auto mode to assume the system setting.
We‚Äôre one of the cool kids now üòé

#### Val Town Universe

Tom created [Val Town Universe](https://www.val.town/universe), a way to explore
vals and their connections visually.

![Untitled](./val-town-newsletter-12/untitled-1.png)

Val Town wouldn‚Äôt be a social site without tagging, so now you can tag people in
Val READMEs and comments.

<video controls><source src="/video/tagging.mp4" /></video>

#### Response body decoded

When your web val returns a `Response`, it technically could be anything (ie
binary) so we show the base64 encoded value. However that‚Äôs annoying when you
know it‚Äôs just text, ie HTML or JSON. Now we show you the parsed response body
when available.

![Untitled](./val-town-newsletter-12/untitled-2.png)

#### Embed vals in Notion

Copy and paste a val link to Notion to embed it. (Before you had to specifically
copy the ‚ÄúEmbed Link‚Äù, but now it auto-converts any val link.) Thanks, friends
at Notion and Iframely!
