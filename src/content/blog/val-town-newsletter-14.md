In the last two weeks, we launched Pull Requests, redesigned the Val Editor, shipped Github Copilot-like AI Suggestions, relaunched our docs and blog sites on Astro, and a bunch of smaller things.

Coming up soon is more polish, collaboration features, and custom domains. Hopefully early next year, we're also going to be benchmarking & improving the runtime performance of Val Town v3 and updating the limits accordingly.

The community has made hundreds of really cool vals recently (links below), including through collaboration in the Discord recently. [Come join us!](https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY) üëã

### Pull Requests

You can now send Pull Requests to vals! Below we demonstrate forking a val, adding a feature, submitting a PR, then switching accounts, and merging the PR.

### Editor Redesign

We [redesigned the Val Editor](https://blog.val.town/blog/editor-redesign/) to make it clearer how to run all the different types of vals and view their logs. We are rolling out these changes over the next two weeks.

### AI Suggestions

It's like Github Copilot, but for Val Town!

<video id="copilot" autoPlay loop><source src="/video/copilot-demo.mp4" /></video>

<script>
  let video = document.getElementById("copilot")
  video.playbackRate = 2
</script>

It's free for everyone in beta. We'll follow up with pricing once we work out the kinks.

### OSS Docs

We launched our [new docs site](https://docs.val.town/) on [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and [open-sourced it](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-docs).
