Today we're revamping the design of standalone val pages to make
them a lot more understandable. Something that we've learned
from hours spent walking new folks through Val Town is that
the individual val page could be disorienting and hard to visually
parse.

People are making amazing vals, and we want them to shine! So we've
made a pretty big design pass for the val page:

<div class='lineup'>
  <div align="center">
    <Image src={Before} alt="Val Page Before Redesign" />
    <figcaption>
    Val page before
    </figcaption>
  </div>

  <div align="center">
    <Image src={After} alt="Val Page After" />
    <figcaption>
    Val page after
    </figcaption>
  </div>
</div>

Vals in list contexts will look the same for now: the val editor
was designed for those kinds of space-constrained situations. But
now val pages make it much clearer what val you're looking at,
who made it, and what you can do with it. They also make the readme
much more obviously a readme. The goal is understandability.

We hope this is a big improvement for folks new to Val Town, and
it makes val pages a lot more readable and shareable. We'd love
to hear from you about this - [join us in the Discord](https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY)!https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY
