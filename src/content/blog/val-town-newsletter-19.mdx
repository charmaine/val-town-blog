In the last month, we shipped a full-screen val Editor, a new 5x faster HTTP val runtime, a Dashboard for your account, a new Search experience, a redesign for our AI bot Townie and the ability to use tools, a new Trending leaderboard, User Profile filters and sorts, and a bunch of other improvements and bug fixes.

We've also been on a blogging spree: [Moving from Express to Fastify](/blog/fastify/), [Here's why we're also using TypeBox](/blog/typebox), and [Why spawning a new process in Node is so slow?](/blog/node-spawn-performance).

On the livestream, I coded with [Mary Rose Cook on concert ticket alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ2uqaqD10E), [Sahil Lavingia on a stock buyback form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-TXoB0BmSA), and [Peter van Hardenberg on a Automerge change notifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIVgi4mRXxk).

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Full-screen editor

At long last, you can edit your vals in full-screen. This new editor also features a classic left-sidebars with all your vals and folders. Thanks [bcjordan](https://www.val.town/u/bcjordan) and [hunter](https://www.val.town/u/hunter) for the [feature](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/58) [requests](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/137) üôè

Try it out: [val.town/editor](https://val.town/editor)

import Editor from "./val-town-newsletter-19/Editor.png";

<Image src={Editor} alt="Demo of the new editor for @jxnblk" />

One of my favorite features is the ability to multi-select vals (shift-click) and drag them into folders to clean up your workspace.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è 5x Faster HTTP vals at scale

We built a new runtime for HTTP vals that is much faster at scale by re-using existing Deno processes. We've seen up to a 5x speedup for some vals. Try it out by selecting `HTTP (Preview)` for your val's type. Learn more in [our announcement post](/blog/http-preview/).

## üìä Dashboard

We built a Dashboard to help you more quickly navigate your vals and see what's happening in Val Town. Thanks [nbbaier](https://www.val.town/u/nbbaier) for the [feature request](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/8) üôè

You can access your dashboard today at [val.town/dashboard](https://val.town/dashboard).

## üîé Val Search

Search results are now powered by exact matching, exact phrase matching, and "vibes-based" vector search. We sort results in part by indicators of that val's quality, ie how many times it's been forked or liked. You can filter results by val type and by whether the val was created by you or not.

Try some searches: [anthropic](https://val.town/search?q=anthropic) | [openai](https://val.town/search?q=openai) | [substrate](https://val.town/search?q=substrate) | [embeddings](https://val.town/search?q=embeddings) | [react client side](https://val.town/search?q=react%20client%20side)

import Search from "./val-town-newsletter-19/Search.png";

## ü§ñ Townie redesign & tool-use

Townie has a new look! It can also use the entire Val Town API for you. This means you can ask Townie to list, create, update, and delete not only vals but also blobs and sqlite data ‚Äì it can run anything in our [new API](https://docs.val.town/openapi). Townie automatically performs GET requests and asks you to confirm before running any mutative action.

In the following demo video, you'll notice a couple times Townie didn't do exactly what I wanted, but we were able to work around it by doing it ourselves or asking it again. Townie is still a work in progress, but it's a lot of fun to play with.

## ü¶æ VALL-E Demo

LLM code generation is so exciting right now that we weren't able to limit ourselves to just Townie. We built a prototype inspired by Anthropic Projects called [VALL-E](https://val.town/v/janpaul123/VALLE) that's great at writing vals for you. We built another prototype, [VALL-E Draw](https://www.val.town/v/janpaul123/VALLEdraw), which embeds it in TLDraw! Both were built entirely in vals ‚Äì so you can fork and tweak em!

The video below demos how to create multiple apps simultaneously with VALL-E Draw: a Hacker News clone with a real backend and a simple hello world example app with craazzzy styles. Here's [two](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1813699804729663495) [demos](https://x.com/stevekrouse/status/1812980867381489962) of the original VALL-E.

## üî• Trending

Collect likes, forks, and references to gain fame and fortune ‚Äì well at least fame ‚Äì on the new and improved Val Town trending leaderboard. The new trending has a fresh look and much more useful rankings.

Check it out: [val.town/trending](https://val.town/trending)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Profile filters and sorts

Profile pages now have filters and sorts to help you find the vals you're looking for. You can filter by val type and sort by date created, date updated, likes, and alphabetically.

Try it out on some power users' profiles: [pomdtr](https://val.town/u/pomdtr) | [iamseeley](https://val.town/u/iamseeley) | [nbbaier](https://www.val.town/u/nbbaier) | [substrate](https://val.town/u/substrate) | [yawnxyx](https://www.val.town/u/yawnxyz)
