In the last month, we shipped TODO

TODO: link to Tom's new blogs.

We're currently working on TODO

You all have been making some amazing vals!

## ↔️ Fullscreen editor

At long last, you can edit your vals in full-screen. This new editor also features a classic left-sidebar with all your vals and folders.

You can find the new editor by navigating to any val you own and clicking the `Code Editor (Beta)` button.

One of my favorite features is the ability to multi-select vals (shift-click) and drag them into folders to clean up your workspace.
