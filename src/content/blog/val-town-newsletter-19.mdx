import { Image } from "astro:assets";

In the last month, we shipped a full-screen val editor, a new 5x faster HTTP val runtime, a dashboard for your account, a new search experience, a redesign for our AI bot Townie and the ability to use tools, and more!

We've also been on a blogging spree: [Moving from Express to Fastify](/blog/fastify/), [Zod is amazing. Here's why we're also using TypeBox](/blog/typebox), and [Why spawning a new process in Node is so slow?](/blog/node-spawn-performance).

On the livestream, I coded with [Mary Rose Cook on concert ticket alerts](TODO), [Sahil Lavingia on a stock buyback form](TODO), and [Peter van Hardenberg on a Automerge change notifier](TODO).

We're currently working on TODO

You all have been making some amazing vals!

## ‚ÜîÔ∏è Full-screen editor

At long last, you can edit your vals in full-screen. This new editor also features a classic left-sidebar with all your vals and folders. Thanks [bcjordan](https://www.val.town/u/bcjordan) and [hunter](https://www.val.town/u/hunter) for the [feature](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/58) [requests](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/137) for a full-screen editor üôè

Try it out: [val.town/editor](https://val.town/editor)

import Editor from "./val-town-newsletter-19/Editor.png";

<div align="center">
  <Image src={Editor} alt="Demo of the new editor for @jxnblk" />
</div>

One of my favorite features is the ability to multi-select vals (shift-click) and drag them into folders to clean up your workspace.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è HTTP (Preview)

We built a new runtime for HTTP vals that is much faster at scale by re-using existing Deno processes. We've seen up to a 5x speedup for some vals. Try it out by selecting `HTTP (Preview)` for your val's type. Learn more in [our announcement post](/blog/http-preview/).

## üìä Dashboard

We are working on a new dashboard to help you more quickly navigate your vals and see what's happening in Val Town. Thanks [nbbaier](https://www.val.town/u/nbbaier) for the [feature request](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/8) üôè

You can access your dashboard today at [val.town/dashboard](https://val.town/dashboard).

import Dashboard from "./val-town-newsletter-19/dashboard.png";

<div align="center">

    src={Dashboard.src}
    alt="Demo of the new dashboard for @stevekrouse"
    style="height: 900px;"
  />
</div>

## üîé Val Search

Search results are now powered by exact matching, exact phrase matching, and "vibes-based" vector search. We highlight matches and sort results in part by indicators of that val's quality, ie how many times it's been forked or liked. You can filter results by val type and by whether the val was created by you or not.

import Search from "./val-town-newsletter-19/Search.png";

<div align="center">
  <img
    src={Search.src}
    alt="Search results for 'vercel ai sdk'"
    width="700px"
  />
</div>

## ü§ñ Townie redesign & tool-use!

Townie has a new look! It also has the "tool-use" ability to use the entire Val Town API for you!

TODO video demo - I should also tweet about this

## ü¶æ VALLE Demo

LLM code generation these days is so exciting that we weren't able to limit ourselves to just Townie. We built a prototype inspired by Anthropic Projects called VALLE that's great at writing vals for you. VALLE was built entirely in a val ‚Äì so you can fork it and tweak it.
