We are joining the [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/)! The pledge terms are to donate at least $2k per full-time developer per year to open-source. We have donated $9,600 in 2024 so far, which for our team of 4, comes out to $2,400 per person. We will be donating more this year, but we are only counting the donations we've made so far.

We've donated to:

- [esh.sh](https://esm.sh/) - $1000
- [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) - $1000
- [tsx](https://tsx.is/) - $1000
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - $1000
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - $1000
- [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) - $1000
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - $800
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) - $800
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) - $500
- [rclone](https://rclone.org/) - $500
- [Hono](https://hono.dev/) - $500
- [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) - $500

We are also small sponsors of [Folk Computer](https://folk.computer/), [Alexander Obenauer](https://alexanderobenauer.com/), and the [HTML Energy podcast](https://html.energy/), but we don't count those donations towards the pledge.

Thanks so much to all the maintainers of these projects, and all the ones haven't donated to yet! We are so grateful for your work. We hope these donations go a small way towards showing our appreciation and making open-source more sustainable. Ask your company to [join the pledge](https://osspledge.com/join/) too!
