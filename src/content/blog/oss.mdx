We are joining the [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/). This means we will donate at least $2k per full-time employed developer per year to open-source. We have donated $11,350 so far, which for our team of 4, comes out to $2,837 per person.

So far we've donated to:

- CodeMirror
- esh.sh
- Drizzle
- sindresorhus
- Fastify
- Colin (Zod)
- Mock Service Worker
- rclone
- tsx
- husky (TODO get person's name)

We have also donated to Folk Computer, Alexander Obenour, and will be sponsoring a couple episodes of the HTML Energy podcast, but we don't count those donations towards the pledge.

TODO linkify all these ^

Thanks so much to all the maintainers of these projects, and all the ones we use but haven't donated to yet! We are so grateful for your work. We hope these donations go a small way towards showing our appreciation. We look forward to donating more as we grow!
