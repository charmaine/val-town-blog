We are joining the [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/)! The pledge terms are to donate at least $2k per full-time developer per year to open-source. We have donated $9,600 in 2024 so far, which for our team of 4, comes out to $2,400 per person. We will be donating more this year, but we are only counting the donations we've made so far.

So far we've donated to:

We hope these donations go a small way towards showing our appreciation and making open-source more sustainable. Ask your company to [join the pledge](https://osspledge.com/join/) too!
