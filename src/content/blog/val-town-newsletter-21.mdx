[Townie](https://val.town/townie), our AI code assistant, got huge upgrades this month. We fixed a dozen bugs and shipped many of your feature requests. We also made big strides in HTTP val performance, are deprecating some old APIs, and made a number of other upgrades and fixes, detailed below.

You all created hundreds of awesome vals last month! Our favorite 50 are featured at the bottom of this newsletter.

## ü§ñ Townie upgrades

Townie can blow-your-mind and it can make you tear your hair out. We're working hard to make it more of the former and less of the latter. Here's some of the improvements we've made:

- Townie can create & edit any kind of val (not just HTTP vals)
- You can upload images to Townie to help it understand your request
- You can view requests and logs from within Townie
- We made it easier to revert to past versions (more improvements incoming)
- Townie can detect and fix syntax errors and client-side errors
- Tom fundamentally re-architected to be less buggy
- Jackson setup a suite of evals to improve Townie's accuracy
- Townie diffs are copyable without the `+` and `-` characters
- Diffs are off by default. You can request them explicitly
- Townie doesn't overwrite your hand-written code as often
- Townie has a [docs page](https://docs.val.town/reference/townie/) with tips & tricks

Please continue to reach out when Townie does something amazing or awful. Your feedback is invaluable. And as some of you know, I (Steve) am always happy to jump on a call or try to fix bugs for you. I'm steve@val.town.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast Vals

Vals continue to get faster and more scalable. Now [a 'hello world' val](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/hello_world) responds in about 50ms, which is comparable to other cloud providers. Our servers are in Ohio and we're testing here in New York, so your mileage may vary if you live further from Ohio.

## Deprecating old APIs

We are deprecating a number of old APIs that are no longer in use:

- Express vals ‚Äì discontinued on 10/7/2024
- Old HTTP runtime ‚Äì migrating on 10/20/2024 ([how to upgrade](https://docs.val.town/troubleshooting/migrating-deprecated-http-vals/))
- Eval API ‚Äì discontinuing on 11/1/2024

These changes effect less than 1% of our users. If you're effected, you will receive an email with more information on how to upgrade.

The exciting part about deprecations is that it means we'll be able to ship faster because we won't be maintaining old code that almost nobody is using. Max rebuilding our code-running infrastructure to even faster and more scalable, and not having to support these old APIs will make his job a lot easier.

## Prettier errors

HTTP vals now have prettier errors. They sometimes have stack traces and link to the relevant source. (We're working improving the stack traces & links.)
