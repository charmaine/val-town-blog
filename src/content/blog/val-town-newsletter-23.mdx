## Val Projects Beta

Vals are great for small projects, but what if you want to build something bigger? Introducing Val Projects, a new way to organize multiple vals, files, and folders into a single place. Where a val is like a GitHub gist, a val project is like a GitHub repository.

Projects support:

- Static assets, like images, videos, css, html, etc
- Multiple files and folders
- Environment variables scoped to the project (that code outside the project _can't_ access)

Projects will soon support:

- Branches, forking, pull requests, and three-way merges
- Townie, with the ability to understand and edit multiple files

Projects are currently in private beta. We're looking for more passionate Val Town users to try it out and give feedback. If you're a Pro user, please reach out to steve@val.town, and we'll add you to the beta.

## Use Cases

"What can I do with Val Town?" We get this question a lot, so we made a page to help answer it.

Check it out and see if it sparks any ideas for you! Maybe you'll find a val that's perfect for your needs and you can fork it and make it your own. If you don't find what you're looking for, let us know. If you want to submit a val to be included, we'd love that too!

## Upgraded to Deno 2

[Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0) is out, and Val Town is now running it. We're currently on Deno v2.1.2, but you can always check which version we're running [here](https://www.val.town/v/std/deno_version).

In addition to some performance and security upgrades, Deno 2 also includes a couple exciting features:

- `process` and `Buffer` are now globally available, which means you don't have to import them anymore, which increases compatibility with Node.js code ([example](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/processBufferDeno2Example))
- WebAssembly imports are supported out-of-the-box ([example](https://www.val.town/v/just_be/deno2wasmExample))

## Updated pricing

## Other updates
