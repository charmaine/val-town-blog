## Val Projects Beta

Vals are great for small projects, but what if you want to build something bigger? Introducing Val Projects, a new way to organize multiple vals, files, and folders into a single place. Where a val is like a GitHub gist, a val project is like a GitHub repository.

Projects will support:

- Static assets, like images, videos, css, html, etc
- Multiple files and folders
- Environment variables scoped to the project (that code outside the project _can't_ access)
- Forking, pull requests, and three-way merges
- Townie, with the ability to understand and edit multiple files

Projects currently support about half of these features, but because it's such a big effort, we've released it to about a dozen users in a private beta. If you're a Pro users who can't wait to try it out and give us feedback, please reach out to steve@val.town, and I'll add you to the beta.

## Use Cases

What can I do with Val Town? We get this question a lot, so we made a page to help answer it.

TODO screenshot

Check it out and see if it sparks any ideas for you! Maybe you'll find a val that's perfect for your needs and you can fork it and make it your own. We'd really appreciate feedback on this page. If you don't find what you're looking for, let us know. If you want to submit a val to be included, we'd love that too! If you try to fork someone else's val and fail, hit us up and we'll help you get it working.

## Upgraded to Deno 2

[Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0) is out, and Val Town is now running it. We're currently on 2.1.2, but you can always check which version we're running [here](https://www.val.town/v/std/deno_version).

This upgrade should be mostly transparent to you, but it comes with a couple nice features:

- `process` and `Buffer` are now globally available, so means you don't have to import them anymore, which increases compatibility with Node.js code ([example](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/processBufferDeno2Example))
- WebAssembly imports ([example](https://www.val.town/v/just_be/deno2wasmExample))

## Yearly pricing
