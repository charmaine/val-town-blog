ü•≥ Happy new year! Some 2024 highlights:

- Raised a seed round of funding
- Max, Jackson, Justin, Sophie & Charmaine joined our team
- Made our infra fast and stable
- Launched Townie, a shockingly useful code assistant
- Tens of thousands of you made hundreds of thousands of vals run hundreds of millions of times

Looking forward to 2025:

- Projects ‚Äì groups of vals, files folders ‚Äì with forks & 3-ways merges (currently in private beta)
- Scalable infra & usage-based billing
- Team accounts for companies to collaborate
- Improvements to Discovery, Search, Townie, Observability
- Continuing to [fast-follow](/fast-follow/) with LLMs
- SOC 2

Sophie and Charmaine have joined the Val Town team ü•≥. [Sophie](https://sophiehouser.com/)
is a designer, programmer, and artist, who just moved from Berlin to join us. She's
best-known for [a viral app she made as a teenager](https://sophiehouser.com/tampon-run-), but most recently worked with Nike and Delivery Hero. [Charmaine](https://www.charmaineklee.com/)
is a technical product manager, with a deep background in developer tools. She's worked at
Snapchat, Unity Labs, and Microsoft. We're thrilled to have them both on board!

## Val Projects Beta

Vals are great for small projects, but what if you want to build something bigger? Introducing Val Projects, a new way to organize multiple vals, files, and folders into a single place. Where a val is like a GitHub gist, a val project is like a GitHub repository.

TODO screenshot

Projects support:

- Static assets, like images, videos, css, html, etc
- Multiple files and folders
- Environment variables scoped to the project (that code outside the project _can't_ access)

Projects will soon support:

- Branches, forking, pull requests, and three-way merges
- Townie, with the ability to understand and edit multiple files

Projects are currently in private beta. We're looking for more passionate Val Town users to try it out and give feedback. If you're a Pro user, please reach out to steve@val.town, and we'll add you to the beta.

## Use Cases

"What can I do with Val Town?" We get this question a lot, so we made a page to help answer it.

TODO screenshot

Check it out and see if it sparks any ideas for you! Maybe you'll find a val that's perfect for your needs and you can fork it and make it your own. If you don't find what you're looking for, let us know. If you want to submit a val to be included, we'd love that too!

## Upgraded to Deno 2

[Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0) is out, and Val Town is now running it. We're currently on Deno v2.1.2, but you can always check which version we're running [here](https://www.val.town/v/std/deno_version).

In addition to some performance and security upgrades, Deno 2 also includes a couple exciting features:

- `process` and `Buffer` are now globally available, which means you don't have to import them anymore, which increases compatibility with Node.js code ([example](https://www.val.town/v/stevekrouse/processBufferDeno2Example))
- WebAssembly imports are supported out-of-the-box ([example](https://www.val.town/v/just_be/deno2wasmExample))
