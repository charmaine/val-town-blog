Val Town Projects have landed. If you like vals, you are going to _love_ Projects.

The team was cooking this month. We've shipped over a hundred features and upgrades, including Highlight to Edit with AI,
Logs totally redesigned, and public endpoints with private code.

Next month, you can look forward to editing your Val Town Projects from Cursor, Windsurf, any other VSCode fork, or local editor. Sublime Text anyone?

## Val Town Projects

TODO photo / video

- Find a cool project
- Fork it, show it running in my account, view the logs
- Make some changes
- Open a PR back to the original author

Projects are groups of vals, files, and folders that are versioned collectively, and deployed on our serverless platform. They support powerful workflows, such as feature branches and pull requests, that make it easy to build and deploy large applications with the classic Val Town simplicity and lightness.

Projects are a great way to build with friends, and to share your work with the world. Learn more about Val Town Projects in our [announcement post](./projects) and [docs](https://docs.val.town/projects/).

## Highlight to Edit with AI

Introducing Highlight to edit. We've yet again brought one of your favorite ways to code with AI into Val Town.

TODO video

You can now select text in any val and then click Edit or Cmd+L to ask AI to rewrite that section of code. This solves the problem with Townie rewriting too much or our completions not rewriting enough. Now you can highlight exactly what you want edited.

Huge shout-out to the folks at [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) for [this open-source CodeMirror plugin](https://marimo-team.github.io/codemirror-ai/)!

## Logs Redesign

We've redesigned our logs to be easier to read and navigate ‚Äì with powerful filters and sorts to help you find what you're looking for fast.

TODO VIDEO

The new logs pair beautifully with Val Town Projects, letting you view all the logs across a project at once.

## Public endpoints with private code

At long last, we've updated val privacy permissions to made it easy for you to create public HTTP endpoints, while keeping your code private.

<figure align="center">
  <Image
    style={{
      maxWidth: "600px",
      borderRadius: "8px",
      border: "1px solid var(--border)",
      overflow: "hidden",
    }}
    src={Privacy}
    alt="Val Privacy Menu"
  />
</figure>

Now `Private` keeps your code private, but your HTTP endpoint open. We've grandfathered old `Private` HTTP endpoints into a `Legacy Private` state, which keeps their HTTP endpoints closed to preserve the previous behavior. You can [learn more about val privacy states here](https://docs.val.town/reference/permissions/).

Thanks Robin Sloan and TODO for requesting this üôè

## Client-side errors in the HTTP preview

If your Val Town code throws an error while running on the server, you will see that in our beautifully redesigned logs. But if your code throws an error on the client side, that used to be something you'd have to seek in the browser console.

Now, we surface those client-side errors right in every HTTP preview, so you can see them right where you're working. To enable this, add this to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://esm.town/v/std/catch"></script>
```

We've instructed Townie to do this for you automatically, so some of your vals may already have it installed.

## Markdown editor supports line-wrapping

TODO photo or video, Tom already has one

## Projects API

The Projects Read API is out in beta. You can now list and retrieve public or your own projects and their branches and files. Here are the routes we currently support:

```http
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}
GET /v1/projects
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}/content
GET /v1/alias/projects/{username}/{project_name}
```

It's already been useful. For example, [here's a Val Town Project that let's you download Projects as zips](https://www.val.town/x/shouser/getProjectsAsZips).

You can view the [API docs](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/beta) and [SDK docs](https://github.com/val-town/sdk/blob/6f80c8470f055aa30c5c3cc34fcf715c81df1937/api.md#projects-1) to get started.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

We have [a new perspective building for AI coding at Val Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBfliNf9C4). We have paused all Townie development in favor of building out the Projects API to enable local dev workflows. In other words, we are you what you've been asking for: edit your vals from Cursor ‚Äì or wherever else.

- Projects Write API
- Local dev: edit vals from your local editor (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, vim, etc)
- New account-wide logs
- Customizable `val.run` domains for Project HTTP vals
- Faster & scalable runtime
- Bug fixes to our in-browser TypeScript editor
- Improved code search
- Metrics to track your usage and limits
- Comments on pull requests
- Team accounts
- SOC2 compliance
- ‚Ä¶and much more!

Please [make feature requests and vote](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions?discussions) on what you'd like to see next.
