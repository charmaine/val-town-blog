TODO summary

## Val Town Projects

TODO

Forks are crazy fast, ie compared to github, I have a video of this

- env variables with descriptions and forked to new projects

I should probably link to all the best projects to copy and some of my livestreams talking about them, and a link to sign up to chat with me and charmaine to get personally onboarded.

## Highlight to AI

TODO

Huge shoutout to Marimo

## Logs Redesign

TODO

## Public endpoints with private code

TODO, thanks Robin Sloan and others for requesting this üôè

- public is oss
- unlisted is now for semi-collab
- private is closed-source with no collaborators, team accounts will solve that soon!

## Client-side errors in the HTTP preview

TODO, legacy private, link to docs maybe, and projects are already on the new semantics, which are explained inline now

## Markdown editor supports line-wrapping

TODO
