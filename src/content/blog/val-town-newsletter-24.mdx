## Val Town Projects

Val Town Projects have landed.

TODO photo / video

If you liked vals, you are going to _love_ Projects. Val Town Projects are extremely powerful tech, but with the classic Val Town simplicity and lightness.

Forks are crazy fast, ie compared to github, I have a video of this

- env variables with descriptions and forked to new projects

I should probably link to all the best projects to copy and some of my livestreams talking about them, and a link to sign up to chat with me and charmaine to get personally onboarded.

## Highlight to edit

Introducing Highlight to edit. We've yet again brought one of your favorite ways to code with AI into Val Town.

TODO video

You can now select text in any val and then click Edit or Cmd+L to ask AI to rewrite that section of code. This solves the problem with Townie rewriting too much or our completions not rewriting enough. Now you can highlight exactly what you want edited.

Huge shout-out to the folks at [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) for [this open-source CodeMirror plugin](https://marimo-team.github.io/codemirror-ai/)!

## Logs Redesign

We've redesigned our logs to be easier to read and navigate ‚Äì with powerful filters and sorts to help you find what you're looking for fast.

The new logs pair beautifully with Val Town Projects, letting you view all the logs across a project at once.

## Public endpoints with private code

At long last, we've updated val privacy permissions to made it easy for you to create public HTTP endpoints, while keeping your code private.

<figure align="center">
  <Image
    style={{
      maxWidth: "600px",
      borderRadius: "8px",
      border: "1px solid var(--border)",
      overflow: "hidden",
    }}
    src={Privacy}
    alt="Val Privacy Menu"
  />
</figure>

Now `Private` keeps your code private, but your HTTP endpoint open. We've grandfathered old `Private` HTTP endpoints into a `Legacy Private` state, which keeps their HTTP endpoints closed to preserve the previous behavior. You can [learn more about val privacy states here](https://docs.val.town/reference/permissions/).

Thanks Robin Sloan and TODO for requesting this üôè

## Client-side errors in the HTTP preview

If your Val Town code throws an error while running on the server, you will see that in our beautifully redesigned logs. But if your code throws an error on the client side, that used to be something you'd have to seek in the browser console.

TODO photo

Now, we surface those client-side errors right in every HTTP preview, so you can see them right where you're working. To enable this, add this to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://esm.town/v/std/catch"></script>
```

We've instructed Townie to do this for you automatically, so some of your vals may already have it installed.

## Markdown editor supports line-wrapping

TODO photo or video, Tom already has one

## Projects API

The Projects API is halfway done! You can now list and retrieve public or your own projects and their branches and files. Here are the routes we currently support:

```http
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}
GET /v1/projects
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches/{branch_id}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/branches
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files/{path}/content
GET /v1/alias/projects/{username}/{project_name}
```

You can view the [API docs](https://docs.val.town/openapi#tag/beta) and [SDK docs](https://github.com/val-town/sdk/blob/6f80c8470f055aa30c5c3cc34fcf715c81df1937/api.md#projects-1) to get started.
