Last month, we launched a major overhaul of Townie, our AI code assistant that helps you build, edit, and deploy your Val Town projects. Val Town is already the best place to turn an idea into a deployed app. Townie makes it even better.

## Townie in Action

Want to see what it's like to build with Townie? Here's a video where I use it to make an RSVP page in just a few prompts and a few minutes. We're talking working, deployed, persistent apps in under 5 minutes. No joke!

But the best way to see what Townie is like is to [just go play with it.](https://val.town/townie)

## ðŸ”¥ The Community is on Fire!

Our users have been creating some super cool stuff with Townie. Here are a few highlights:

### Blog summaries

With a hand full of prompts, [Peter made a neat tool](https://x.com/peterhartree/status/1825254990169927976) to get Claude to summarize a blog post just by pasting a link.

### Mood Tracking

Marcus was able to build a really nice looking [mood-tracking app](https://x.com/MarcusSandstrom/status/1830544711850823697) in no time at all.
