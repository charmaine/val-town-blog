Today we're releasing **Val Town Projects** in public beta. Projects are containers for vals, files, and folders that are versioned collectively, and deployed on Val Town. Where a Val Town Val is like a GitHub Gist, a Val Town Project is like a GitHub Repo. {/* Dan Levine doesn't like this analogy; maybe remove it? */} Projects dramatically increase the scope of what you can build in Val Town.

## Vals are too small

Projects solve the biggest problem with Val Town: vals are too small. A vals is just a single file. It's incredible what you all have been able to do with them, but they become unwieldy after a thousand lines or so. This pain is especially acute when you're using an LLM that is trying to edit or rewrite hundreds or thousands of lines in a single file.

{/* TODO Photo */}

You can break up a single val into multiple vals that import each other, but that becomes untenable quickly. For example, say you have a couple of vals running in production that you want to make a medium-sized change to. If you don't want to affect production while you work, you'd have to fork each of those vals manually. Then you'd have to manually update all the imports in each of those vals to point to the forked versions. Then when you're ready to merge back to main, you'd have to manually update all the imports again. This is no fun. Instead most users either stuffed all their code into a single super long val, just made all their changes directly to their main production vals (somtimes breaking it briefly), or moved off Val Town entirely.

Clearly we needed a solution to dramatically increase the scope of what you can build on Val Town.

## Enter Projects

Projects are containers for multiple vals, files, and folders that are versioned, branched, forked, and merged back collectively. Projects support incredibly powerful workflows, such as the desired feature branch workflow described above.

As you may know, Val Town deploys your code in 100ms. This is a magical way to code _directly in the cloud_ – [instead of on localhost and deploying to the cloud later](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost). This kind of live feedback loop is incredibly fun. It also means that you are building in the exact same environment that you'll deploy to, cutting out all the complexity of managing multiple environments.

However, as described above, just because you're deploying to the cloud on every save doesn't mean you want to deploy to _production_ on every save. Feature branches in projects give you the best of both worlds: you can rapidly prototype in the exact same environment that you'll deploy to, but without affecting production. It's like localhost and PR previews had a baby: super fast iteration cycles, paired with hosted URLs you can immediately share.

And the final kicker is scale. Our vision is that once your app is running on Val Town, you don't have to worry about provisioning more or less compute. Our serverless platform will automatically scale your app to handle any number of users. Our Scale Plan is slated to launch in Q2 2025.

## Project Features

Projects support the following features:

- **Multiple vals, files, and folders, versioned collectively** – the version number of a Project increases every time you make a change to any of the vals, files, or folders in the Project
- **Multiple entrypoints** – you can have multiple HTTP, Cron, and Email vals that all have their own URLs, schedules, and email addresses, respectively
- **Branches** - you can branch off main, and branch off branches. You can pull from upstream, and merge back upstream
- **Forks** - other users can fork your Project, and you can fork other user's Projects
- **Relative imports** – you can import files and folders relative to the project root, which means you don't have to update your imports when you branch or fork a project
- **Static text files** – projects can contain non-val static text files, such as CSS, HTML, and text files
- **Scoped environment variables** – Projects have their own environment variables, which code outside the Project in your Val Town account can't access
- **Readmes are version controlled** – unlike in vals, readmes in Projects are just files, and version controlled collectively with the rest of the Project
- **Inline AI code completion** – powered by [Codeium](https://codeium.com)
- **Full-screen Editor** - with a file-tree, logs, and browser preview

## Coming soon

Projects will soon support:

- Resolving merge conflicts
- Beta API for Projects
- Townie, or [some other sort of AI assistance](./fast-follow/)
- Reverting to a previous version
- Previewing past versions
- Protecting (locking) the main branch (so you can only edit it via branches)
- Images and videos, and other binary static files
- Pull requests from other user's to your Project
- Collaborators & Team Accounts
- ...and much, much more! Let us know what you want to see next!
