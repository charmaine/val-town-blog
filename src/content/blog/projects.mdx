Today, we're releasing Val Town Projects in public beta. Projects unlock a whole new level of complexity for what you can build in Val Town. Projects are containers for vals, files, and folders that are versioned collectively, and deployed on our serverless platform. They support powerful workflows, such as feature branches, that make it easy to build and deploy complex applications.

## Vals are too small

Projects solve the biggest problem with Val Town: vals are too small. A val is just a single file. Despite that, you all have built some incredible things with vals, like A, B, C, D, E. TODO: add some examples here from past newsletters.

But vals simply become unwieldy after about thousand lines or so. This pain is especially acute when you're using an LLM that is trying to edit or rewrite hundreds or thousands of lines in a single file.

    unwieldy after a thousand lines

Unfortunately, things get _worse_ if you tried breaking up a single val into multiple vals that import each other. For example, I broke up the [Date Me Directory](https://val.town/stevekrouse/dateme), an alternative dating website I manage, into a handful of vals, one for each page in the site. But this means that
whenever I want to make a medium-sized change to the size without affecting the deployed app, I need to manually fork each of those vals one-by-one, and then manually update all the imports in each of them to point to the forked versions. This was miserable.

    dating website that became an unwieldy collection of vals with many
    disorganized forks
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Instead most users either stuffed all their code into a single super long val, just made all their changes directly to their main production vals (sometimes breaking it briefly), or moved off Val Town entirely. Clearly we need a solution to dramatically increase the scope of what you can build on Val Town.

## Enter Projects

Projects are containers for multiple vals, files, and folders that are versioned, branched, forked, and merged back collectively. With Projects, you can create feature branches and test changes without affecting production.

As you may know, Val Town deploys your code in 100ms. This is a magical way to code _directly in the cloud_ – [instead of on localhost and deploying to the cloud later](https://dx.tips/the-end-of-localhost). This kind of live feedback loop is incredibly fun. It also means that you are building in the exact same environment that you'll deploy to, cutting out all the complexity of managing multiple environments.

However, as described above, just because you're deploying to the cloud on every save doesn't mean you want to deploy to _production_ on every save. Feature branches in projects give you the best of both worlds: you can rapidly prototype in the exact same environment that you'll deploy to, but without affecting production. It's like localhost and PR previews had a baby: super fast iteration cycles, paired with hosted URLs you can immediately share.

And the final kicker is scale. Our vision is that once your app is running on Val Town, it's deployed. You don't have to worry about provisioning more or less compute. Our serverless platform will automatically scale your app to handle any number of users. (Our Scale Plan is slated to launch in Q2 2025. For now, Val Town scales to 100k and 1m runs per day on [the Free and Pro plans](https://www.val.town/pricing), respectively.)

## Projects are not git repos

We considered building Projects as git repos. We decided that becoming a git host at scale was too much complexity for the small subset of git's features that we wanted (diffs, branches, merges). We realized that it'd be much simpler to build our own version control system.

This sounds like sacrilege – even to us. Everyone at Val Town is aa happy git and GitHub user. Yet if you think about it, many any of the web's pro tools had to build their own version control, including Google Docs, Figma, and Notion. We feel very heartened to read about how speculative and uncertain this decision felt at Figma to build their own multiplayer system instead of using OTs (operational transforms), which was the standard at the time given its success in Google Docs.

> As a startup we value the ability to ship features quickly, and OTs were unnecessarily complex for our problem space. So we built a custom multiplayer system that's simpler and easier to implement.
>
> At the time, we weren’t sure building this feature was the right product decision. No one was clamoring for a multiplayer design tool—if anything, people hated the idea.
>
> ...Our bet paid off, and these days it’s obvious that multiplayer is the way all productivity tools on the web should work, not just design.

We too think we built something that nobody was clamoring for, but that we hope will be obvious in the future. Experience programmers used to git & GitHub will feel right at home in Val Town Projects – branching, forking, merging, and pull requesting – but all from the same platform you're coding and deploying on.

New programmers might never need to learn git at all. I can still remember the frustration of learning git for the first time, and I'm excited to think that we might be able to save some people from that pain. Particularly in this new age of LLM programming, we think there's an opportunity to build a new kind of version control system that's simpler than git.

And if you really need git, Projects are git-friendly, and can easily be synced to and from a git repo. We're racing to release a beta API for Projects, which will allow you to fully own your data, sync to and from a git repo, and whatever else you want.

## Project Features

Projects support the following features:

- **Multiple vals, files, and folders, versioned collectively** – the version number of a Project increases every time you make a change to any of the vals, files, or folders in the Project
- **Multiple entrypoints** – you can have multiple HTTP, Cron, and Email vals that all have their own URLs, schedules, and email addresses, respectively
- **Branches** - you can branch off main, and branch off branches. You can pull from upstream, and merge back upstream
- **Forks** - other users can fork your Project, and you can fork other user's Projects
- **Relative imports** – you can import files and folders relative to the project root, which means you don't have to update your imports when you branch or fork a project
- **Static text files** – projects can contain non-val static text files, such as CSS, HTML, and text files
- **Scoped environment variables** – Projects have their own environment variables, which code outside the Project in your Val Town account can't access
- **Readmes are version controlled** – unlike in vals, readmes in Projects are just files, and version controlled collectively with the rest of the Project
- **Inline AI code completion** – powered by [Codeium](https://codeium.com)
- **Full-screen Editor** - with a file-tree, logs, and browser preview

## Coming soon

Projects will soon support:

- Resolving merge conflicts
- Beta API for Projects
- Townie, or [some other sort of AI assistance](./fast-follow/)
- Reverting to a previous version
- Previewing past versions
- Protecting (locking) the main branch (so you can only edit it via branches)
- Images and videos, and other binary static files
- Pull requests from other user's to your Project
- Collaborators & Team Accounts
- ...and much, much more! Let us know what you want to see next!

## Resources

If you get stuck, please reach out in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY), or email us directly (help@val.town), and include a link to your project. We're here to help!

## Start building today

You can start building with Projects today by creating a new Project via the blue `New` button in the top right in your [Val Town account](https://val.town/).

TODO: talk about the sorts of things we're excited for people to make. Give more concrete examples, like a personal CRM, or a blog, or an alternative dating website, or a backend for you startup prototype, or a starter template for your API that users can fork and have immediately running in production, this is where Nate goes

We can't wait to see what you build!

If you're new to Val Town, you can [sign up free with Github here](https://val.town/).
