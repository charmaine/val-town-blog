Today we're releasing **Val Town Projects** in public beta. Projects are versioned containers for multiple vals, files, and folders. Where a Val Town Val is like a GitHub Gist, a Val Town Project is like a GitHub Repo. {/* Dan Levine doesn't like this analogy; maybe remove it? */} Projects dramatically increase the size and complexity of what you can build in Val Town.

## Vals are too small

Projects solve the biggest problem with Val Town: vals are too small. A vals is just a single file, and optionally a readme. It's incredible what you all have been able to do with them, but things become unwieldy after a thousand lines or so. This pain is especially acute when you're using an LLM that is trying to edit or rewrite your code.

Of course, you can break up a single val into multiple vals that import each other, but that becomes untenable quickly. You don't have any support for managing these vals as a unit. Forks, branches, importing, and versioning all clash across multiple vals.

## Enter Projects

## Versioning

## Branches

## Three-way merges

## Static Files

Currently just CSS, HTML, and text files

Readmes are now just files, and version controlled

Soon like images, videos

## Pull Requests

## Scoped environment variables

## Coming soon

- API for Projects
- Townie support
