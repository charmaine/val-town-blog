TODO description

You all have made hundreds of really cool vals (links below). [Come join us in Discord!](https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY) üëã

### Custom domains

We released a heavily requested feature - custom domains. Custom domains allow you to use your own domain names to access the HTTP vals you created. This feature enables a more branded and professional experience for users visiting your vals. This is a feature for [Pro subscribers](https://www.val.town/pricing) only.

![A custom domain configured to direct HTTP requests to "amazingVal"](./val-town-newsletter-15/custom-domains.png)

You can add your domain or subdomain in the [custom domain settings](https://www.val.town/settings/domains). For more info take a look at our [documentation page](https://docs.val.town/reference/custom-domains/).

Big thanks to [SaaS Custom Domains](https://saascustomdomains.com/) for making the implementation much easier.
