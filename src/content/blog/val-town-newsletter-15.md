TODO description

You all have made hundreds of really cool vals (links below). [Come join us in Discord!](https://discord.gg/dHv45uN5RY) üëã

### Custom domains

We released a heavily requested feature - custom domains. Custom domains allow you to use your own domain names to access the HTTP vals you created. This feature enables a more branded and professional experience for users visiting your vals. This is a feature for [Pro subscribers](https://www.val.town/pricing) only.

![A custom domain configured to direct HTTP requests to "amazingVal"](./val-town-newsletter-15/custom-domains.png)

You can add your domain or subdomain in the [custom domain settings](https://www.val.town/settings/domains). For more info take a look at our [documentation page](https://docs.val.town/reference/custom-domains/).

Big thanks to [SaaS Custom Domains](https://saascustomdomains.com/) for making the implementation much easier.

### Logs ‚Äì larger, faster, streamed, and scalable

We upgraded the logs viewing experience. Now vals' logs are live-streamed, can be much larger and are stored in a much more scalable way, ensuring we have room for more logging-related features. As your val is being executed you are able to see the log messages appear in real-time. This was requested in a [discussion #30](https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/30).

```ts
import { delay } from "https://deno.land/std/async/delay.ts";

console.log("Val execution started");
await delay(2000);
console.log(" 10% [=         ] 100%");
await delay(1000);
console.log(" 30% [===       ] 100%");
await delay(1000);
console.log(" 70% [=======   ] 100%");
await delay(1000);
console.log("100% [==========] 100%");
await delay(1000);
console.log("Finished");
```
![A video showing how logs are being streamed](./val-town-newsletter-15/logs_vid.mp4)

Previously, logs had a size limit of ??? and we were able to increase it to ???. This makes is possible to debug larger data sets or longer processing chains without worrying about the logs cutting of mid-execution.

Initialy we were storing logs locally and then after a while we moved them to [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/). Now we're using [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) which enabled the real-time preview functionality and makes the whole system more scalable.

- TODO: Replace `???` with actual limit sizes.
- TODO: Close: https://github.com/val-town/val-town-product/discussions/30


### ‚ö°Ô∏è HTTP vals respond 100ms faster on average

Till now when HTTP val returned a response, Val Town waited for a while before sending that response. The reason for that was to ensure that all promises were resolved before terminating val's execution. We introduced an optimization, where we're returning the val's HTTP response immediately, speeding up client's exieprience significantly.

TODO:
- link to the discussion (can't find the discussion)
- and the discord announcement? https://discord.com/channels/1020432421243592714/1020432421243592717/1201996373013319690
- Add a fancy graph comparing before-and-after. Maybe in a style of Chrome dev tools network tab timimg?

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Running tasks after returning the HTTP response

Because we're returning HTTP responses immediately, non-resolved promises continue their execution after the response has been returned.

This allows you to speed your vals even more by performing some non-critical tasks (like logging) after sending the response:

- TODO: Include code example https://www.val.town/v/neverstew/earlyWebReturn

You can also take the _optimistic execution_ approach and perform your database operations after returning the `200 OK`:

- TODO: Include code example:
```ts
// HTTP val handling PUT request
// 1. Generate new UUID
// 2. Return new UUID early
// 3. Save data to DB after the response
```

### Val Town status page

Nobody likes when a website is down, but it's even worse not being able to figure out if it's down for everyone. We now have a public status page to answer that question!
