- fal is an API to make AI images super fast
- val town users can now use the fal api right away - no api key necessary
- for example you could make...
- you can fork any val that uses fal and it will work right away
  - like this example one
- or you could paste these instructions to townie
- eventually you'll need your own fal api key once you want to scale
- how this works under the hood
- if you're an api provider, contact steve@val.town to launch a partnership to bring your api to val town users
