[Fal](https://fal.ai/) has an API for generating AI images incredibly quickly, ie under 120ms. Specializing in diffusion models, Fal has no cold starts and a pay-for-what-you-use pricing model.

Today we're announcing a partnership with Fal to bring their API to Val Town users. You can use Fal in your vals right away, even without an API key!

## Use-cases

TODO - rewrite this section

- Text-to-image applications: Use Fal to integrate real-time text-to-image generation in applications, enabling users to create complex visual content from textual descriptions instantly
- Real-time image processing: Use Fal for applications requiring instantaneous image analysis and modification, such as real-time filters, enhancements, or object recognition in streaming video

## Getting started

Val Town users can now use the Fal API right away - no API key necessary. The quickest way to get started is to fork [faltown](https://www.val.town/v/drochetti/faltown), an example text-to-image app powered by the new Fal integration.

Or you could copy and paste this text into Townie:
